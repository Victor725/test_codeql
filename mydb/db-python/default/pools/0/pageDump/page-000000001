    Instances of the Logger class represent a single logging channel. A
    "logging channel" indicates an area of an application. Exactly how an
    "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an
    application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified
    by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area
    of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read
    XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting,
    channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are
    separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So
    in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper
    level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels.
    There is no arbitrary limit to the depth of nesting.
    
        Initialize the logger with a name and an optional level.
        propagatedisabled
        Set the logging level of this logger.  level must be an int or a str.
        
        Log 'msg % args' with severity 'DEBUG'.

        To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
        a true value, e.g.

        logger.debug("Houston, we have a %s", "thorny problem", exc_info=1)
        isEnabledFor_log
        Log 'msg % args' with severity 'INFO'.

        To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with

        logger.info("Houston, we have a %s", "interesting problem", exc_info=1)
        
        Log 'msg % args' with severity 'WARNING'.

        To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
        a true value, e.g.

        logger.warning("Houston, we have a %s", "bit of a problem", exc_info=1)

f_linenoco_namemakeRecordlno
        A factory method which can be overridden in subclasses to create
        specialized LogRecords.
        Attempt to overwrite %r in LogRecord
        Low-level logging routine which creates a LogRecord and then calls
        all the handlers of this logger to handle the record.
        
        Call the handlers for the specified record.

        This method is used for unpickled records received from a socket, as
        well as those created locally. Logger-level filtering is applied.
        callHandlersaddHandlerhdlr
        Add the specified handler to this logger.
        removeHandler
        Remove the specified handler from this logger.
        hasHandlers
        See if this logger has any handlers configured.

        Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
        logger hierarchy. Return True if a handler was found, else False.
        Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate"
        attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger which
        is checked for the existence of handlers.
        
        Pass a record to all relevant handlers.

        Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
        logger hierarchy. If no handler was found, output a one-off error
        message to sys.stderr. Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a
        logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that
        will be the last logger whose handlers are called.
        No handlers could be found for logger "%s"
"No handlers could be found for logger"" \"%s\"\n"getEffectiveLevel
        Get the effective level for this logger.

        Loop through this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy,
        looking for a non-zero logging level. Return the first one found.
        
        Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?
        getChild
        Get a logger which is a descendant to this one.

        This is a convenience method, such that

        logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')

        is the same as

        logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')

        It's useful, for example, when the parent logger is named using
        __name__ rather than a literal string.
        picklePicklingErrorlogger cannot be pickledRootLogger
    A root logger is not that different to any other logger, except that
    it must have a logging level and there is only one instance of it in
    the hierarchy.
    
        Initialize the logger with the name "root".
        
    An adapter for loggers which makes it easier to specify contextual
    information in logging output.
    
        Initialize the adapter with a logger and a dict-like object which
        provides contextual information. This constructor signature allows
        easy stacking of LoggerAdapters, if so desired.

        You can effectively pass keyword arguments as shown in the
        following example:

        adapter = LoggerAdapter(someLogger, dict(p1=v1, p2="v2"))
        
        Process the logging message and keyword arguments passed in to
        a logging call to insert contextual information. You can either
        manipulate the message itself, the keyword args or both. Return
        the message and kwargs modified (or not) to suit your needs.

        Normally, you'll only need to override this one method in a
        LoggerAdapter subclass for your specific needs.
        
        Delegate a debug call to the underlying logger.

        Delegate an exception call to the underlying logger.
        
        Delegate a critical call to the underlying logger.
        
        Delegate a log call to the underlying logger, after adding
        contextual information from this adapter instance.
        
        Set the specified level on the underlying logger.
        
        Get the effective level for the underlying logger.
        
        See if the underlying logger has any handlers.
        
        Low-level log implementation, proxied to allow nested logger adapters.
        
    Do basic configuration for the logging system.

    This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
    configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
    It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
    to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.

    The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
    sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
    add the handler to the root logger.

    A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
    the default behaviour.

    filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
              filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
    filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
              (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
    format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
    datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
    style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
              type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
              %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
              - defaults to '%').
    level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
    stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
              that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
              are present, 'stream' is ignored.
    handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
              handlers, which will be added to the root handler. Any handler
              in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
              assigned the formatter created in this function.
    force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers
              attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before
              carrying out the configuration as specified by the other
              arguments.
    encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
              the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened.
    errors    If specified together with a filename, this value is passed to the
              created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened in text mode. If not specified, the default value is
              `backslashreplace`.

    Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
    rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
    remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
    using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
    when the handler is closed.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.2
       Added the ``style`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.3
       Added the ``handlers`` parameter. A ``ValueError`` is now thrown for
       incompatible arguments (e.g. ``handlers`` specified together with
       ``filename``/``filemode``, or ``filename``/``filemode`` specified
       together with ``stream``, or ``handlers`` specified together with
       ``stream``.

    Return a logger with the specified name, creating it if necessary.

    If no name is specified, return the root logger.
    
    Log a message with severity 'CRITICAL' on the root logger. If the logger
    has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a
    pre-defined format.
    
    Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger. If the logger has
    no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
    format.
    
    Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger, with exception
    information. If the logger has no handlers, basicConfig() is called to add
    a console handler with a pre-defined format.
    
    Log a message with severity 'WARNING' on the root logger. If the logger has
    no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
    format.
    The 'warn' function is deprecated, use 'warning' instead"The 'warn' function is deprecated, "
    Log a message with severity 'INFO' on the root logger. If the logger has
    no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
    format.
    
    Log a message with severity 'DEBUG' on the root logger. If the logger has
    no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
    format.
    
    Log 'msg % args' with the integer severity 'level' on the root logger. If
    the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler
    with a pre-defined format.
    
    Disable all logging calls of severity 'level' and below.
    handlerList
    Perform any cleanup actions in the logging system (e.g. flushing
    buffers).

    Should be called at application exit.
    atexit
    This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the
    "No handlers could be found for logger XXX" one-off warning. This is
    important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user
    of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be
    produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate
    a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or
    package.
    Stub._warnings_showwarning_showwarning
    Implementation of showwarnings which redirects to logging, which will first
    check to see if the file parameter is None. If a file is specified, it will
    delegate to the original warnings implementation of showwarning. Otherwise,
    it will call warnings.formatwarning and will log the resulting string to a
    warnings logger named "py.warnings" with level logging.WARNING.
    formatwarningpy.warnings%s
    If capture is true, redirect all warnings to the logging package.
    If capture is False, ensure that warnings are not redirected to logging
    but to their original destinations.

    Formatter instances are used to convert a LogRecord to text.

    Formatters need to know how a LogRecord is constructed. They are
    responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can
    be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter
    allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the
    style-dependent default value, "%(message)s", "{message}", or
    "${message}", is used.

    The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
    knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
    above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
    formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
    attributes in a LogRecord are described by:

    %(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
    %(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
                        WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    %(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
                        "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")

        Initialize the formatter with specified format strings.

        Initialize the formatter either with the specified format string, or a
        default as described above. Allow for specialized date formatting with
        the optional datefmt argument. If datefmt is omitted, you get an
        ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format.

        Use a style parameter of '%', '{' or '$' to specify that you want to
        use one of %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` (``{}``) formatting or
        :class:`string.Template` formatting in your format string.

        Return the creation time of the specified LogRecord as formatted text.

        This method should be called from format() by a formatter which
        wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be overridden
        in formatters to provide for any specific requirement, but the
        basic behaviour is as follows: if datefmt (a string) is specified,
        it is used with time.strftime() to format the creation time of the
        record. Otherwise, an ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format is used.
        The resulting string is returned. This function uses a user-configurable
        function to convert the creation time to a tuple. By default,
        time.localtime() is used; to change this for a particular formatter
        instance, set the 'converter' attribute to a function with the same
        signature as time.localtime() or time.gmtime(). To change it for all
        formatters, for example if you want all logging times to be shown in GMT,
        set the 'converter' attribute in the Formatter class.
        'u'
        Return the creation time of the specified LogRecord as formatted text.

        Format the specified record as text.

        The record's attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a
        string formatting operation which yields the returned string.
        Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps
        are carried out. The message attribute of the record is computed
        using LogRecord.getMessage(). If the formatting string uses the
        time (as determined by a call to usesTime(), formatTime() is
        called to format the event time. If there is exception information,
        it is formatted using formatException() and appended to the message.

    Filter instances are used to perform arbitrary filtering of LogRecords.

    Loggers and Handlers can optionally use Filter instances to filter
    records as desired. The base filter class only allows events which are
    below a certain point in the logger hierarchy. For example, a filter
    initialized with "A.B" will allow events logged by loggers "A.B",
    "A.B.C", "A.B.C.D", "A.B.D" etc. but not "A.BB", "B.A.B" etc. If
    initialized with the empty string, all events are passed.

        This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
        encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,
        exceptions get silently ignored. This is what is mostly wanted
        for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in
        the logging system, they are more interested in application errors.
        You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
        The record which was being processed is passed in to this method.

        Emit a record.

        If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record.
        The record is then written to the stream with a trailing newline.  If
        exception information is present, it is formatted using
        traceback.print_exception and appended to the stream.  If the stream
        has an 'encoding' attribute, it is used to determine how to do the
        output to the stream.

    Instances of the Logger class represent a single logging channel. A
    "logging channel" indicates an area of an application. Exactly how an
    "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an
    application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified
    by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area
    of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read
    XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting,
    channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are
    separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So
    in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper
    level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels.
    There is no arbitrary limit to the depth of nesting.

        Low-level log implementation, proxied to allow nested logger adapters.
        'b'
    Do basic configuration for the logging system.

    This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
    configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
    It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
    to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.

    The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
    sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
    add the handler to the root logger.

    A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
    the default behaviour.

    filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
              filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
    filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
              (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
    format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
    datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
    style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
              type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
              %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
              - defaults to '%').
    level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
    stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
              that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
              are present, 'stream' is ignored.
    handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
              handlers, which will be added to the root handler. Any handler
              in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
              assigned the formatter created in this function.
    force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers
              attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before
              carrying out the configuration as specified by the other
              arguments.
    encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
              the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened.
    errors    If specified together with a filename, this value is passed to the
              created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened in text mode. If not specified, the default value is
              `backslashreplace`.

    Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
    rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
    remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
    using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
    when the handler is closed.

       Added the ``style`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.3
       Added the ``handlers`` parameter. A ``ValueError`` is now thrown for
       incompatible arguments (e.g. ``handlers`` specified together with
       ``filename``/``filemode``, or ``filename``/``filemode`` specified
       together with ``stream``, or ``handlers`` specified together with

    filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
              (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
    format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
    datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
    style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
              type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
              %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
              - defaults to '%').
    level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
    stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
              that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
              are present, 'stream' is ignored.

    encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
              the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened.

    This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the
    "No handlers could be found for logger XXX" one-off warning. This is
    important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user
    of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be
    produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate
    a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or
    package.

Tkinter provides classes which allow the display, positioning and
control of widgets. Toplevel widgets are Tk and Toplevel. Other
widgets are Frame, Label, Entry, Text, Canvas, Button, Radiobutton,
Checkbutton, Scale, Listbox, Scrollbar, OptionMenu, Spinbox
LabelFrame and PanedWindow.

Properties of the widgets are specified with keyword arguments.
Keyword arguments have the same name as the corresponding resource
under Tk.

Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack
or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid
available in every Widget.

Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument
command) or with the method bind.

Example (Hello, World):
import tkinter
from tkinter.constants import *
tk = tkinter.Tk()
frame = tkinter.Frame(tk, relief=RIDGE, borderwidth=2)
frame.pack(fill=BOTH,expand=1)
label = tkinter.Label(frame, text="Hello, World")
label.pack(fill=X, expand=1)
button = tkinter.Button(frame,text="Exit",command=tk.destroy)
button.pack(side=BOTTOM)
tk.mainloop()

    Instances of this type are generated if one of the following events occurs:

    KeyPress, KeyRelease - for keyboard events
    ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Motion, Enter, Leave, MouseWheel - for mouse events
    Visibility, Unmap, Map, Expose, FocusIn, FocusOut, Circulate,
    Colormap, Gravity, Reparent, Property, Destroy, Activate,
    Deactivate - for window events.

    If a callback function for one of these events is registered
    using bind, bind_all, bind_class, or tag_bind, the callback is
    called with an Event as first argument. It will have the
    following attributes (in braces are the event types for which
    the attribute is valid):

        serial - serial number of event
    num - mouse button pressed (ButtonPress, ButtonRelease)
    focus - whether the window has the focus (Enter, Leave)
    height - height of the exposed window (Configure, Expose)
    width - width of the exposed window (Configure, Expose)
    keycode - keycode of the pressed key (KeyPress, KeyRelease)
    state - state of the event as a number (ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,
                            Enter, KeyPress, KeyRelease,
                            Leave, Motion)
    state - state as a string (Visibility)
    time - when the event occurred
    x - x-position of the mouse
    y - y-position of the mouse
    x_root - x-position of the mouse on the screen
             (ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, KeyPress, KeyRelease, Motion)
    y_root - y-position of the mouse on the screen
             (ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, KeyPress, KeyRelease, Motion)
    char - pressed character (KeyPress, KeyRelease)
    send_event - see X/Windows documentation
    keysym - keysym of the event as a string (KeyPress, KeyRelease)
    keysym_num - keysym of the event as a number (KeyPress, KeyRelease)
    type - type of the event as a number
    widget - widget in which the event occurred

+_subst_format_strbindBind to this widget at event SEQUENCE a call to function FUNC.

        SEQUENCE is a string of concatenated event
        patterns. An event pattern is of the form
        <MODIFIER-MODIFIER-TYPE-DETAIL> where MODIFIER is one
        of Control, Mod2, M2, Shift, Mod3, M3, Lock, Mod4, M4,
        Button1, B1, Mod5, M5 Button2, B2, Meta, M, Button3,
        B3, Alt, Button4, B4, Double, Button5, B5 Triple,
        Mod1, M1. TYPE is one of Activate, Enter, Map,
        ButtonPress, Button, Expose, Motion, ButtonRelease

        Colormap, Gravity Reparent, Configure, KeyPress, Key,
        Unmap, Deactivate, KeyRelease Visibility, Destroy,
        Leave and DETAIL is the button number for ButtonPress,
        ButtonRelease and DETAIL is the Keysym for KeyPress and
        KeyRelease. Examples are
        <Control-Button-1> for pressing Control and mouse button 1 or
        <Alt-A> for pressing A and the Alt key (KeyPress can be omitted).
        An event pattern can also be a virtual event of the form
        <<AString>> where AString can be arbitrary. This
        event can be generated by event_generate.
        If events are concatenated they must appear shortly
        after each other.

        FUNC will be called if the event sequence occurs with an
        instance of Event as argument. If the return value of FUNC is
        "break" no further bound function is invoked.

        An additional boolean parameter ADD specifies whether FUNC will
        be called additionally to the other bound function or whether
        it will replace the previous function.

        Bind will return an identifier to allow deletion of the bound function with
        unbind without memory leak.

        be managed by wm. toplevel windows will be treated like frame
        windows once they are no longer managed by wm, however, the menu
        option configuration will be remembered and the menus will return
        once the widget is managed again.wm_frameReturn identifier for decorative frame of this widget if present.wm_geometrynewGeometrySet geometry to NEWGEOMETRY of the form =widthxheight+x+y. Return
        current value if None is given.wm_gridbaseWidthbaseHeightwidthIncheightIncInstruct the window manager that this widget shall only be
        resized on grid boundaries. WIDTHINC and HEIGHTINC are the width and
        height of a grid unit in pixels. BASEWIDTH and BASEHEIGHT are the
        number of grid units requested in Tk_GeometryRequest.wm_grouppathNameSet the group leader widgets for related widgets to PATHNAME. Return
        the group leader of this widget if None is given.wm_iconbitmapbitmapSet bitmap for the iconified widget to BITMAP. Return
        the bitmap if None is given.

        Under Windows, the DEFAULT parameter can be used to set the icon
        for the widget and any descendants that don't have an icon set
        explicitly.  DEFAULT can be the relative path to a .ico file
        (example: root.iconbitmap(default='myicon.ico') ).  See Tk
        documentation for more information.iconbitmap-defaultwm_iconifyDisplay widget as icon.iconifywm_iconmaskSet mask for the icon bitmap of this widget. Return the
        mask if None is given.iconmaskwm_iconnamenewNameSet the name of the icon for this widget. Return the name if
        None is given.iconnamewm_iconphotoSets the titlebar icon for this window based on the named photo
        images passed through args. If default is True, this is applied to
        all future created toplevels as well.

        The data in the images is taken as a snapshot at the time of
        invocation. If the images are later changed, this is not reflected
        to the titlebar icons. Multiple images are accepted to allow
        different images sizes to be provided. The window manager may scale
        provided icons to an appropriate size.

        On Windows, the images are packed into a Windows icon structure.
        This will override an icon specified to wm_iconbitmap, and vice
        versa.

        On X, the images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X property,
        which most modern window managers support. An icon specified by
        wm_iconbitmap may exist simultaneously.

        Return a tuple of (x,y,width,height) which gives the bounding
        box of the visible part of the character at the given index.opReturn whether between index INDEX1 and index INDEX2 the
        relation OP is satisfied. OP is one of <, <=, ==, >=, >, or !=.Counts the number of relevant things between the two indices.
        If index1 is after index2, the result will be a negative number
        (and this holds for each of the possible options).

        The actual items which are counted depends on the options given by
        args. The result is a list of integers, one for the result of each
        counting option given. Valid counting options are "chars",
        "displaychars", "displayindices", "displaylines", "indices",
        "lines", "xpixels" and "ypixels". There is an additional possible
        option "update", which if given then all subsequent options ensure
        that any possible out of date information is recalculated.Turn on the internal consistency checks of the B-Tree inside the text
        widget according to BOOLEAN.Delete the characters between INDEX1 and INDEX2 (not included).dlineinfoReturn tuple (x,y,width,height,baseline) giving the bounding box
        and baseline position of the visible part of the line containing
        the character at INDEX.Return the contents of the widget between index1 and index2.

        The type of contents returned in filtered based on the keyword
        parameters; if 'all', 'image', 'mark', 'tag', 'text', or 'window' are
        given and true, then the corresponding items are returned. The result
        is a list of triples of the form (key, value, index). If none of the
        keywords are true then 'all' is used by default.

        If the 'command' argument is given, it is called once for each element
        of the list of triples, with the values of each triple serving as the
        arguments to the function. In this case the list is not returned.func_nameappend_triple-commandeditInternal method

        This method controls the undo mechanism and
        the modified flag. The exact behavior of the
        command depends on the option argument that
        follows the edit argument. The following forms
        of the command are currently supported:

        edit_modified, edit_redo, edit_reset, edit_separator
        and edit_undo

        edit_modifiedGet or Set the modified flag

        If arg is not specified, returns the modified
        flag of the widget. The insert, delete, edit undo and
        edit redo commands or the user can set or clear the
        modified flag. If boolean is specified, sets the
        modified flag of the widget to arg.
        modifiededit_redoRedo the last undone edit

        When the undo option is true, reapplies the last
        undone edits provided no other edits were done since
        then. Generates an error when the redo stack is empty.
        Does nothing when the undo option is false.

        If the undo option is true. An edit action is defined
        as all the insert and delete commands that are recorded
        on the undo stack in between two separators. Generates
        an error when the undo stack is empty. Does nothing

        spinboxReturn a tuple of X1,Y1,X2,Y2 coordinates for a
        rectangle which encloses the character given by index.

        The first two elements of the list give the x and y
        coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen
        area covered by the character (in pixels relative
        to the widget) and the last two elements give the
        width and height of the character, in pixels. The
        bounding box may refer to a region outside the
        visible area of the window.
        Delete one or more elements of the spinbox.

        First is the index of the first character to delete,
        and last is the index of the character just after
        the last one to delete. If last isn't specified it
        defaults to first+1, i.e. a single character is
        deleted.  This command returns an empty string.
        Returns the spinbox's stringAlter the position of the insertion cursor.

        The insertion cursor will be displayed just before
        the character given by index. Returns an empty string
        Returns the name of the widget at position x, y

        Return value is one of: none, buttondown, buttonup, entry
        Returns the numerical index corresponding to index
        Insert string s at index

         Returns an empty string.
        Causes the specified element to be invoked

        The element could be buttondown or buttonup
        triggering the action associated with it.
        Records x and the current view in the spinbox window;

        used in conjunction with later scan dragto commands.
        Typically this command is associated with a mouse button
        press in the widget. It returns an empty string.
        Compute the difference between the given x argument
        and the x argument to the last scan mark command

        It then adjusts the view left or right by 10 times the
        difference in x-coordinates. This command is typically
        associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to
        produce the effect of dragging the spinbox at high speed
        through the window. The return value is an empty string.
        Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character
        given by index,

        Then adjust that end of the selection to be at index
        (i.e including but not going beyond index). The other
        end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
        select to commands. If the selection isn't currently in
        the spinbox, then a new selection is created to include
        the characters between index and the most recent selection
        anchor point, inclusive.
        Clear the selection

        If the selection isn't in this widget then the
        command has no effect.
        selection_elementSets or gets the currently selected element.

        If a spinbutton element is specified, it will be

        panedwindowAdd a child widget to the panedwindow in a new pane.

        The child argument is the name of the child widget
        followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to
        manage the windows. The possible options and values
        are the ones accepted by the paneconfigure method.
        Remove the pane containing child from the panedwindow

        All geometry management options for child will be forgotten.
        Identify the panedwindow component at point x, y

        If the point is over a sash or a sash handle, the result
        is a two element list containing the index of the sash or
        handle, and a word indicating whether it is over a sash
        or a handle, such as {0 sash} or {2 handle}. If the point
        is over any other part of the panedwindow, the result is
        an empty list.
        proxy_coordReturn the x and y pair of the most recent proxy location
        coordproxy_forgetRemove the proxy from the display.
        proxy_placePlace the proxy at the given x and y coordinates.
        sashsash_coordReturn the current x and y pair for the sash given by index.

        Index must be an integer between 0 and 1 less than the
        number of panes in the panedwindow. The coordinates given are
        those of the top left corner of the region containing the sash.
        pathName sash dragto index x y This command computes the
        difference between the given coordinates and the coordinates
        given to the last sash coord command for the given sash. It then
        moves that sash the computed difference. The return value is the
        empty string.
        sash_markRecords x and y for the sash given by index;

        Used in conjunction with later dragto commands to move the sash.
        sash_placePlace the sash given by index at the given coordinates
        panecgetQuery a management option for window.

        Option may be any value allowed by the paneconfigure subcommand
        paneconfigureQuery or modify the management options for window.

        If no option is specified, returns a list describing all
        of the available options for pathName.  If option is
        specified with no value, then the command returns a list
        describing the one named option (this list will be identical
        to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
        option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
        specified, then the command modifies the given widget
        option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
        command returns an empty string. The following options
        are supported:

        after window
            Insert the window after the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        before window
            Insert the window before the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        height size
            Specify a height for the window. The height will be the
            outer dimension of the window including its border, if
            any. If size is an empty string, or if -height is not
            specified, then the height requested internally by the
            window will be used initially; the height may later be
            adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow.
            Size may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        minsize n
            Specifies that the size of the window cannot be made
            less than n. This constraint only affects the size of
            the widget in the paned dimension -- the x dimension
            for horizontal panedwindows, the y dimension for
            vertical panedwindows. May be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.
        padx n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the X-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        pady n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the Y-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        sticky style
            If a window's pane is larger than the requested
            dimensions of the window, this option may be used
            to position (or stretch) the window within its pane.
            Style is a string that contains zero or more of the
            characters n, s, e or w. The string can optionally
            contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
            letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west)
            that the window will "stick" to. If both n and s
            (or e and w) are specified, the window will be
            stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of
            its cavity.
        width size
            Specify a width for the window. The width will be
            the outer dimension of the window including its
            border, if any. If size is an empty string, or
            if -width is not specified, then the width requested
            internally by the window will be used initially; the
            width may later be adjusted by the movement of sashes
            in the panedwindow. Size may be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.

Tkinter provides classes which allow the display, positioning and
control of widgets. Toplevel widgets are Tk and Toplevel. Other
widgets are Frame, Label, Entry, Text, Canvas, Button, Radiobutton,
Checkbutton, Scale, Listbox, Scrollbar, OptionMenu, Spinbox
LabelFrame and PanedWindow.

Properties of the widgets are specified with keyword arguments.
Keyword arguments have the same name as the corresponding resource
under Tk.

Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack
or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid
available in every Widget.

Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument
command) or with the method bind.

Example (Hello, World):

'u'Wrapper functions for Tcl/Tk.

Tkinter provides classes which allow the display, positioning and
control of widgets. Toplevel widgets are Tk and Toplevel. Other
widgets are Frame, Label, Entry, Text, Canvas, Button, Radiobutton,
Checkbutton, Scale, Listbox, Scrollbar, OptionMenu, Spinbox
LabelFrame and PanedWindow.

Properties of the widgets are specified with keyword arguments.
Keyword arguments have the same name as the corresponding resource
under Tk.

Widgets are positioned with one of the geometry managers Place, Pack
or Grid. These managers can be called with methods place, pack, grid
available in every Widget.

Actions are bound to events by resources (e.g. keyword argument
command) or with the method bind.

            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        height size
            Specify a height for the window. The height will be the
            outer dimension of the window including its border, if
            any. If size is an empty string, or if -height is not
            specified, then the height requested internally by the
            window will be used initially; the height may later be
            adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow.
            Size may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        minsize n
            Specifies that the size of the window cannot be made

            for horizontal panedwindows, the y dimension for
            vertical panedwindows. May be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.

            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the X-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        pady n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the Y-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        sticky style
            If a window's pane is larger than the requested
            dimensions of the window, this option may be used
            to position (or stretch) the window within its pane.
            Style is a string that contains zero or more of the
            characters n, s, e or w. The string can optionally
            contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
            letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west)
            that the window will "stick" to. If both n and s
            (or e and w) are specified, the window will be
            stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of
            its cavity.
        width size
            Specify a width for the window. The width will be
            the outer dimension of the window including its
            border, if any. If size is an empty string, or
            if -width is not specified, then the width requested
            internally by the window will be used initially; the
            width may later be adjusted by the movement of sashes
            in the panedwindow. Size may be any value accepted by

        of the available options for pathName.  If option is
        specified with no value, then the command returns a list
        describing the one named option (this list will be identical
        to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
        option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
        specified, then the command modifies the given widget
        option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
        command returns an empty string. The following options
        are supported:

        after window
            Insert the window after the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        before window
            Insert the window before the window specified. window
            should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.
        height size
            Specify a height for the window. The height will be the
            outer dimension of the window including its border, if
            any. If size is an empty string, or if -height is not
            specified, then the height requested internally by the
            window will be used initially; the height may later be
            adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow.
            Size may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        minsize n
            Specifies that the size of the window cannot be made
            less than n. This constraint only affects the size of
            the widget in the paned dimension -- the x dimension
            for horizontal panedwindows, the y dimension for
            vertical panedwindows. May be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.
        padx n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the X-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        pady n
            Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
            extra space to leave on each side of the window in
            the Y-direction. The value may have any of the forms
            accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
        sticky style
            If a window's pane is larger than the requested
            dimensions of the window, this option may be used
            to position (or stretch) the window within its pane.
            Style is a string that contains zero or more of the
            characters n, s, e or w. The string can optionally
            contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
            letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west)
            that the window will "stick" to. If both n and s
            (or e and w) are specified, the window will be
            stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of
            its cavity.
        width size
            Specify a width for the window. The width will be
            the outer dimension of the window including its
            border, if any. If size is an empty string, or
            if -width is not specified, then the width requested
            internally by the window will be used initially; the
            width may later be adjusted by the movement of sashes
            in the panedwindow. Size may be any value accepted by
            Tk_GetPixels.

    If CONFIG_DIR/minion_id exists, use the cached minion ID from that file.
    If no minion id is configured, use multiple sources to find a FQDN.
    If no FQDN is found you may get an ip address.

    Returns two values: the detected ID, and a boolean value noting whether or
    not an IP address is being used for the ID.

        master_opts = salt.config.client_config('/etc/salt/master')

    Returns a dictionary of the Salt Master configuration file with necessary
    options needed to communicate with a locally-running Salt Master daemon.
    This function searches for client specific configurations and adds them to
    the data from the master configuration.

Used by copy and pickle._field_defaultsclass_namespaceAlias for field number _count_elementsTally elements from the iterable.mapping_getDict subclass for counting hashable items.  Sometimes called a bag
    or multiset.  Elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts
    are stored as dictionary values.

    >>> c = Counter('abcdeabcdabcaba')  # count elements from a string

    >>> c.most_common(3)                # three most common elements
    [('a', 5), ('b', 4), ('c', 3)]

    'aaaaabbbbcccdde'
    >>> sum(c.values())                 # total of all counts
    15

    >>> c['a']                          # count of letter 'a'
    5
    >>> for elem in 'shazam':           # update counts from an iterable
    ...     c[elem] += 1                # by adding 1 to each element's count
    >>> c['a']                          # now there are seven 'a'
    7
    >>> del c['b']                      # remove all 'b'
    >>> c['b']                          # now there are zero 'b'
    0

    >>> d = Counter('simsalabim')       # make another counter
    >>> c.update(d)                     # add in the second counter
    >>> c['a']                          # now there are nine 'a'
    9

    >>> c.clear()                       # empty the counter
    >>> c
    Counter()

    Note:  If a count is set to zero or reduced to zero, it will remain
    in the counter until the entry is deleted or the counter is cleared:

    >>> c = Counter('aaabbc')
    >>> c['b'] -= 2                     # reduce the count of 'b' by two
    >>> c.most_common()                 # 'b' is still in, but its count is zero
    [('a', 3), ('c', 1), ('b', 0)]

    Create a new, empty Counter object.  And if given, count elements
        from an input iterable.  Or, initialize the count from another mapping
        of elements to their counts.

        >>> c = Counter()                           # a new, empty counter
        >>> c = Counter('gallahad')                 # a new counter from an iterable
        >>> c = Counter({'a': 4, 'b': 2})           # a new counter from a mapping
        >>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2)                   # a new counter from keyword args

        The count of elements not in the Counter is zero.most_commonList the n most common elements and their counts from the most
        common to the least.  If n is None, then list all element counts.

        >>> Counter('abracadabra').most_common(3)
        [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('r', 2)]

        nlargestIterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count.

        >>> c = Counter('ABCABC')
        >>> sorted(c.elements())
        ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C']

        # Knuth's example for prime factors of 1836:  2**2 * 3**3 * 17**1
        >>> prime_factors = Counter({2: 2, 3: 3, 17: 1})
        >>> product = 1
        >>> for factor in prime_factors.elements():     # loop over factors
        ...     product *= factor                       # and multiply them
        >>> product
        1836

        Note, if an element's count has been set to zero or is a negative
        number, elements() will ignore it.

        Counter.fromkeys() is undefined.  Use Counter(iterable) instead.Like dict.update() but add counts instead of replacing them.

        Source can be an iterable, a dictionary, or another Counter instance.

        >>> c = Counter('which')
        >>> c.update('witch')           # add elements from another iterable
        >>> d = Counter('watch')
        >>> c.update(d)                 # add elements from another counter
        >>> c['h']                      # four 'h' in which, witch, and watch
        4

        self_getsubtractLike dict.update() but subtracts counts instead of replacing them.
        Counts can be reduced below zero.  Both the inputs and outputs are
        allowed to contain zero and negative counts.

        Source can be an iterable, a dictionary, or another Counter instance.

        >>> c = Counter('which')
        >>> c.subtract('witch')             # subtract elements from another iterable
        >>> c.subtract(Counter('watch'))    # subtract elements from another counter
        >>> c['h']                          # 2 in which, minus 1 in witch, minus 1 in watch
        0
        >>> c['w']                          # 1 in which, minus 1 in witch, minus 1 in watch
        -1

        Return a shallow copy.Like dict.__delitem__() but does not raise KeyError for missing values.()Add counts from two counters.

        >>> Counter('abbb') + Counter('bcc')
        Counter({'b': 4, 'c': 2, 'a': 1})

        newcount Subtract count, but keep only results with positive counts.

        >>> Counter('abbbc') - Counter('bccd')
        Counter({'b': 2, 'a': 1})

        Union is the maximum of value in either of the input counters.

        >>> Counter('abbb') | Counter('bcc')
        Counter({'b': 3, 'c': 2, 'a': 1})

        other_count Intersection is the minimum of corresponding counts.

        >>> Counter('abbb') & Counter('bcc')
        Counter({'b': 1})

        Adds an empty counter, effectively stripping negative and zero countsSubtracts from an empty counter.  Strips positive and zero counts,
        and flips the sign on negative counts.

        _keep_positiveInternal method to strip elements with a negative or zero countnonpositiveInplace add from another counter, keeping only positive counts.

        >>> c = Counter('abbb')
        >>> c += Counter('bcc')
        >>> c
        Counter({'b': 4, 'c': 2, 'a': 1})

        Inplace subtract counter, but keep only results with positive counts.

        >>> c = Counter('abbbc')
        >>> c -= Counter('bccd')
        >>> c
        Counter({'b': 2, 'a': 1})

        Inplace union is the maximum of value from either counter.

        >>> c = Counter('abbb')
        >>> c |= Counter('bcc')
        >>> c
        Counter({'b': 3, 'c': 2, 'a': 1})

        Inplace intersection is the minimum of corresponding counts.

        >>> c = Counter('abbb')
        >>> c &= Counter('bcc')
        >>> c
        Counter({'b': 1})

         A ChainMap groups multiple dicts (or other mappings) together
    to create a single, updateable view.

    The underlying mappings are stored in a list.  That list is public and can
    be accessed or updated using the *maps* attribute.  There is no other
    state.

    Lookups search the underlying mappings successively until a key is found.
    In contrast, writes, updates, and deletions only operate on the first
    mapping.

    Initialize a ChainMap by setting *maps* to the given mappings.
        If no mappings are provided, a single empty dictionary is used.

        Create a ChainMap with a single dict created from the iterable.New ChainMap or subclass with a new copy of maps[0] and refs to maps[1:]new_childNew ChainMap with a new map followed by all previous maps.
        If no map is provided, an empty dict is used.

Raise KeyError is maps[0] is empty.No keys found in the first mapping.Remove *key* from maps[0] and return its value.

    library, exporting functions using the standard C calling
    convention (named 'cdecl' on Windows).

    The exported functions can be accessed as attributes, or by
    indexing with the function name.  Examples:

    <obj>.qsort -> callable object
    <obj>['qsort'] -> callable object

Helpful decorators for module writing
IS_WINDOWSDepends
    This decorator will check the module when it is loaded and check that the
    dependencies passed in are in the globals of the module. If not, it will
    cause the function to be unloaded (or replaced).
    dependency_dict
        The decorator is instantiated with a list of dependencies (string of
        global name)

        An example use of this would be:

        .. code-block:: python

            @depends('modulename')
            def test():
                return 'foo'

            OR

            @depends('modulename', fallback_function=function)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        .. code-block:: python

        This can also be done with the retcode of a command, using the
        ``retcode`` argument:

            @depends('/opt/bin/check_cmd', retcode=0)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        It is also possible to check for any nonzero retcode using the
        ``nonzero_retcode`` argument:

            @depends('/opt/bin/check_cmd', nonzero_retcode=True)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        .. note::
            The command must be formatted as a string, not a list of args.
            Additionally, I/O redirection and other shell-specific syntax are
            not supported since this uses shell=False when calling
            subprocess.Popen().

        :param function:
        :return:
        _IsDeprecated
    This decorator should be used only with the deprecated functions
    to mark them as deprecated and alter its behavior a corresponding way.
    The usage is only suitable if deprecation process is renaming
    the function from one to another. In case function name or even function
    signature stays the same, please use 'with_deprecated' decorator instead.

    It has the following functionality:

    1. Put a warning level message to the log, informing that
       the deprecated function has been in use.

    2. Raise an exception, if deprecated function is being called,
       but the lifetime of it already expired.

    3. Point to the successor of the deprecated function in the
       log messages as well during the blocking it, once expired.

    Usage of this decorator as follows. In this example no successor
    is mentioned, hence the function "foo()" will be logged with the
    warning each time is called and blocked completely, once EOF of
    it is reached:

        from salt.util.decorators import is_deprecated

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium")
        def foo():
            pass

    In the following example a successor function is mentioned, hence
    every time the function "bar()" is called, message will suggest
    to use function "baz()" instead. Once EOF is reached of the function
    "bar()", an exception will ask to use function "baz()", in order
    to continue:

        from salt.util.decorators import is_deprecated

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_successor="baz")
        def bar():
            pass

        def baz():
            pass
    with_successor
        Constructor of the decorator 'is_deprecated'.

        :param globals: Module globals
        :param version: Version to be deprecated
        :param with_successor: Successor function (optional)
        :return:
        _successor_decorate
            Decorator function.

            :param args:
            :param kwargs:
            :return:
            The function "{f_name}" is deprecated and will expire in version "{version_name}".'The function "{f_name}" is deprecated and will ''expire in version "{version_name}".'f_nameversion_nameUse successor "{successor}" instead.successorThe lifetime of the function "{f_name}" expired.Please use its successor "{successor}" instead.is_deprecated_WithDeprecated
    This decorator should be used with the successor functions
    to mark them as a new and alter its behavior in a corresponding way.
    It is used alone if a function content or function signature
    needs to be replaced, leaving the name of the function same.
    In case function needs to be renamed or just dropped, it has
    to be used in pair with 'is_deprecated' decorator.

    It has the following functionality:

    1. Put a warning level message to the log, in case a component
       is using its deprecated version.

    2. Switch between old and new function in case an older version
       is configured for the desired use.

    3. Raise an exception, if deprecated version reached EOL and
       point out for the new version.

    Usage of this decorator as follows. If 'with_name' is not specified,
    then the name of the deprecated function is assumed with the "_" prefix.
    In this case, in order to deprecate a function, it is required:

    - Add a prefix "_" to an existing function. E.g.: "foo()" to "_foo()".

    - Implement a new function with exactly the same name, just without
      the prefix "_".

    Example:

        from salt.util.decorators import with_deprecated

        @with_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium")
        def foo():
            "This is a new function"

        def _foo():
            "This is a deprecated function"


    In case there is a need to deprecate a function and rename it,
    the decorator should be used with the 'with_name' parameter. This
    parameter is pointing to the existing deprecated function. In this
    case deprecation process as follows:

    - Leave a deprecated function without changes, as is.

    - Implement a new function and decorate it with this decorator.

    - Set a parameter 'with_name' to the deprecated function.

    - If a new function has a different name than a deprecated,
      decorate a deprecated function with the  'is_deprecated' decorator
      in order to let the function have a deprecated behavior.

    Example:

        from salt.util.decorators import with_deprecated

        @with_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_name="an_old_function")
        def a_new_function():
            "This is a new function"

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_successor="a_new_function")
        def an_old_function():
            "This is a deprecated function"

        global name)

        An example use of this would be:

        .. code-block:: python

            @depends('modulename')
            def test():
                return 'foo'

            OR

            @depends('modulename', fallback_function=function)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        .. code-block:: python

        This can also be done with the retcode of a command, using the
        ``retcode`` argument:

            @depends('/opt/bin/check_cmd', retcode=0)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        It is also possible to check for any nonzero retcode using the
        ``nonzero_retcode`` argument:

            @depends('/opt/bin/check_cmd', nonzero_retcode=True)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

        .. note::
            The command must be formatted as a string, not a list of args.
            Additionally, I/O redirection and other shell-specific syntax are
            not supported since this uses shell=False when calling
            subprocess.Popen().

            OR

            @depends('modulename', fallback_function=function)
            def test():
                return 'foo'

    This decorator should be used only with the deprecated functions
    to mark them as deprecated and alter its behavior a corresponding way.
    The usage is only suitable if deprecation process is renaming
    the function from one to another. In case function name or even function
    signature stays the same, please use 'with_deprecated' decorator instead.

    It has the following functionality:

    1. Put a warning level message to the log, informing that
       the deprecated function has been in use.

    2. Raise an exception, if deprecated function is being called,
       but the lifetime of it already expired.

    3. Point to the successor of the deprecated function in the
       log messages as well during the blocking it, once expired.

    Usage of this decorator as follows. In this example no successor
    is mentioned, hence the function "foo()" will be logged with the
    warning each time is called and blocked completely, once EOF of
    it is reached:

        from salt.util.decorators import is_deprecated

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium")
        def foo():
            pass

    In the following example a successor function is mentioned, hence
    every time the function "bar()" is called, message will suggest
    to use function "baz()" instead. Once EOF is reached of the function
    "bar()", an exception will ask to use function "baz()", in order
    to continue:

        from salt.util.decorators import is_deprecated

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_successor="baz")
        def bar():
            pass

        def baz():
            pass

    This decorator should be used with the successor functions
    to mark them as a new and alter its behavior in a corresponding way.
    It is used alone if a function content or function signature
    needs to be replaced, leaving the name of the function same.
    In case function needs to be renamed or just dropped, it has
    to be used in pair with 'is_deprecated' decorator.

    It has the following functionality:

    1. Put a warning level message to the log, in case a component
       is using its deprecated version.

    2. Switch between old and new function in case an older version
       is configured for the desired use.

    3. Raise an exception, if deprecated version reached EOL and
       point out for the new version.

    Usage of this decorator as follows. If 'with_name' is not specified,
    then the name of the deprecated function is assumed with the "_" prefix.
    In this case, in order to deprecate a function, it is required:

    - Add a prefix "_" to an existing function. E.g.: "foo()" to "_foo()".

    - Implement a new function with exactly the same name, just without
      the prefix "_".

    Example:

        from salt.util.decorators import with_deprecated

        @with_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium")
        def foo():
            "This is a new function"

        def _foo():
            "This is a deprecated function"


    In case there is a need to deprecate a function and rename it,
    the decorator should be used with the 'with_name' parameter. This
    parameter is pointing to the existing deprecated function. In this
    case deprecation process as follows:

    - Leave a deprecated function without changes, as is.

    - Implement a new function and decorate it with this decorator.

    - Set a parameter 'with_name' to the deprecated function.

    - If a new function has a different name than a deprecated,
      decorate a deprecated function with the  'is_deprecated' decorator
      in order to let the function have a deprecated behavior.

    Example:

        from salt.util.decorators import with_deprecated

        @with_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_name="an_old_function")
        def a_new_function():
            "This is a new function"

        @is_deprecated(globals(), "Beryllium", with_successor="a_new_function")
        def an_old_function():
            "This is a deprecated function"

interchange format.

:mod:`json` exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library
:mod:`marshal` and :mod:`pickle` modules.  It is derived from a
version of the externally maintained simplejson library.

Encoding basic Python object hierarchies::

    >>> import json
    >>> json.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}])
    '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'
    >>> print(json.dumps("\"foo\bar"))
    "\"foo\bar"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\u1234'))
    "\u1234"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\\'))
    "\\"
    >>> print(json.dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True))
    {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO()
    >>> json.dump(['streaming API'], io)
    >>> io.getvalue()
    '["streaming API"]'

Compact encoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> mydict = {'4': 5, '6': 7}
    >>> json.dumps([1,2,3,mydict], separators=(',', ':'))
    '[1,2,3,{"4":5,"6":7}]'

Pretty printing::

    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps({'4': 5, '6': 7}, sort_keys=True, indent=4))
    {
        "4": 5,
        "6": 7
    }

Decoding JSON::

    >>> import json
    >>> obj = ['foo', {'bar': ['baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
    >>> json.loads('["foo", {"bar":["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]') == obj
    True
    >>> json.loads('"\\"foo\\bar"') == '"foo\x08ar'
    True
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO('["streaming API"]')
    >>> json.load(io)[0] == 'streaming API'
    True

Specializing JSON object decoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> def as_complex(dct):
    ...     if '__complex__' in dct:
    ...         return complex(dct['real'], dct['imag'])
    ...     return dct
    ...
    >>> json.loads('{"__complex__": true, "real": 1, "imag": 2}',
    ...     object_hook=as_complex)
    (1+2j)
    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> json.loads('1.1', parse_float=Decimal) == Decimal('1.1')
    True

Specializing JSON object encoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> def encode_complex(obj):
    ...     if isinstance(obj, complex):
    ...         return [obj.real, obj.imag]
    ...     raise TypeError(f'Object of type {obj.__class__.__name__} '
    ...                     f'is not JSON serializable')
    ...
    >>> json.dumps(2 + 1j, default=encode_complex)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).encode(2 + 1j)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> ''.join(json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).iterencode(2 + 1j))
    '[2.0, 1.0]'


Using json.tool from the shell to validate and pretty-print::

    $ echo '{"json":"obj"}' | python -m json.tool
    {
        "json": "obj"
    }
    $ echo '{ 1.2:3.4}' | python -m json.tool

    ``.write()``-supporting file-like object).

    If ``skipkeys`` is true then ``dict`` keys that are not basic types
    (``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``) will be skipped
    instead of raising a ``TypeError``.

    If ``ensure_ascii`` is false, then the strings written to ``fp`` can
    contain non-ASCII characters if they appear in strings contained in
    ``obj``. Otherwise, all such characters are escaped in JSON strings.

    If ``check_circular`` is false, then the circular reference check
    for container types will be skipped and a circular reference will
    result in an ``RecursionError`` (or worse).

    If ``allow_nan`` is false, then it will be a ``ValueError`` to
    serialize out of range ``float`` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``)
    in strict compliance of the JSON specification, instead of using the
    JavaScript equivalents (``NaN``, ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``).

    If ``indent`` is a non-negative integer, then JSON array elements and
    object members will be pretty-printed with that indent level. An indent
    level of 0 will only insert newlines. ``None`` is the most compact
    representation.

    If specified, ``separators`` should be an ``(item_separator, key_separator)``
    tuple.  The default is ``(', ', ': ')`` if *indent* is ``None`` and
    ``(',', ': ')`` otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
    you should specify ``(',', ':')`` to eliminate whitespace.

    ``default(obj)`` is a function that should return a serializable version
    of obj or raise TypeError. The default simply raises TypeError.

    If *sort_keys* is true (default: ``False``), then the output of
    dictionaries will be sorted by key.

    To use a custom ``JSONEncoder`` subclass (e.g. one that overrides the
    ``.default()`` method to serialize additional types), specify it with
    the ``cls`` kwarg; otherwise ``JSONEncoder`` is used.

    ``object_hook`` is an optional function that will be called with the
    result of any object literal decode (a ``dict``). The return value of

    return value of ``object_pairs_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``.
    This feature can be used to implement custom decoders.  If ``object_hook``

    float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).

    ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string
    of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
    int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON integers (e.g. float).

    ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the
    following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.
    This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers
    are encountered.

'u'JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) <http://json.org> is a subset of
JavaScript syntax (ECMA-262 3rd edition) used as a lightweight data
interchange format.

:mod:`json` exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library
:mod:`marshal` and :mod:`pickle` modules.  It is derived from a
version of the externally maintained simplejson library.

Encoding basic Python object hierarchies::

    >>> import json
    >>> json.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}])
    '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'
    >>> print(json.dumps("\"foo\bar"))
    "\"foo\bar"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\u1234'))
    "\u1234"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\\'))
    "\\"
    >>> print(json.dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True))
    {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO()
    >>> json.dump(['streaming API'], io)
    >>> io.getvalue()
    '["streaming API"]'

Compact encoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> mydict = {'4': 5, '6': 7}
    >>> json.dumps([1,2,3,mydict], separators=(',', ':'))
    '[1,2,3,{"4":5,"6":7}]'

Pretty printing::

    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps({'4': 5, '6': 7}, sort_keys=True, indent=4))
    {
        "4": 5,
        "6": 7
    }

Decoding JSON::

    >>> import json
    >>> obj = ['foo', {'bar': ['baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
    >>> json.loads('["foo", {"bar":["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]') == obj
    True
    >>> json.loads('"\\"foo\\bar"') == '"foo\x08ar'
    True
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO('["streaming API"]')
    >>> json.load(io)[0] == 'streaming API'
    True

    (``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``) will be skipped
    instead of raising a ``TypeError``.

    If ``ensure_ascii`` is false, then the strings written to ``fp`` can

If this proves problematic for an SSH command we#     might try simply invoking "/bin/sh -s" and passing the formatted#     SSH_SH_SHIM on SSH stdin.# NOTE: there are two passes of formatting:# 1) Substitute in static values#   - EX_THIN_PYTHON_INVALID  - exit code if a suitable python is not found# 2) Substitute in instance-specific commands#   - DEBUG       - enable shim debugging (any non-zero string enables)#   - SUDO        - load python and execute as root (any non-zero string enables)#   - SSH_PY_CODE - base64-encoded python code to execute#   - SSH_PY_ARGS - arguments to pass to python code# This shim generically loads python code . . . and *no* more.# - Uses /bin/sh for maximum compatibility - then jumps to#   python for ultra-maximum compatibility.# 1.

    :param attrs: options the returner wants to read
    :param __opts__: Optional dict-like object that contains a fallback config
        in case the param `__salt__` is not supplied.

    :param __salt__: Optional dict-like object that exposes the salt API.

        Defaults to empty dict.

        a) if __salt__ contains a 'config.option' configuration options,
            we infer the returner is being called from a state or module run ->
            config is a copy of the `config.option` function

        b) if __salt__ was not available, we infer that the returner is being
        called from the Salt scheduler, so we look for the
        configuration options in the param `__opts__`
        -> cfg is a copy for the __opts__ dictionary

        If supplied, an overriding config profile is read from

    extract_mastersmastersraise_if_empty
    Parses opts and generates a list of master (host,port) addresses.
    By default looks for list of masters in opts['master'] and uses
    opts['master_port'] as the default port when otherwise not provided.

    Use the opts key given by masters for the masters list, default is 'master'
    If parameter port is not None then uses the default port given by port


    Returns a list of host address dicts of the form

    [
        {
            'external': (host,port),
            'internal': (host, port)
        },
        ...

    ]

    When only one address is provided it is assigned to the external address field
    When not provided the internal address field is set to None.

    For a given master the syntax options are as follows:

    hostname [port]

    external: hostname [port]
    [internal: hostaddress [port]]

    Where the hostname string could be either an FQDN or host address
    in dotted number notation.
        master.example.com
        10.0.2.110

    And the hostadress is in dotted number notation

    The space delimited port is optional and if not provided a default is used.
    The internal address is optional and if not provided is set to None

    Examples showing the YAML in /etc/salt/master  conf file:

    Invalid or missing opts['master_port'].emsgInvalid or missing opts[''].hostagesexternalinternalhostageparse_hostnamedefault_port
    Parse hostname string and return a tuple of (host, port)
    If port missing in hostname string then use default_port
    If anything is not a valid then return None

    hostname should contain a host and an option space delimited port

Lib/ctypes.util.find_library() support for AIX
Similar approach as done for Darwin support by using separate files
but unlike Darwin - no extension such as ctypes.macholib.*

dlopen() is an interface to AIX initAndLoad() - primary documentation at:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/dlopen.htm
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/load.htm

AIX supports two styles for dlopen(): svr4 (System V Release 4) which is common on posix
platforms, but also a BSD style - aka SVR3.

From AIX 5.3 Difference Addendum (December 2004)
2.9 SVR4 linking affinity
Nowadays, there are two major object file formats used by the operating systems:
XCOFF: The COFF enhanced by IBM and others. The original COFF (Common
Object File Format) was the base of SVR3 and BSD 4.2 systems.
ELF:   Executable and Linking Format that was developed by AT&T and is a
base for SVR4 UNIX.

While the shared library content is identical on AIX - one is located as a filepath name
(svr4 style) and the other is located as a member of an archive (and the archive
is located as a filepath name).

The key difference arises when supporting multiple abi formats (i.e., 32 and 64 bit).
For svr4 either only one ABI is supported, or there are two directories, or there
are different file names. The most common solution for multiple ABI is multiple
directories.

For the XCOFF (aka AIX) style - one directory (one archive file) is sufficient
as multiple shared libraries can be in the archive - even sharing the same name.
In documentation the archive is also referred to as the "base" and the shared
library object is referred to as the "member".

For dlopen() on AIX (read initAndLoad()) the calls are similar.
Default activity occurs when no path information is provided. When path
information is provided dlopen() does not search any other directories.

For SVR4 - the shared library name is the name of the file expected: libFOO.so
For AIX - the shared library is expressed as base(member). The search is for the
base (e.g., libFOO.a) and once the base is found the shared library - identified by
member (e.g., libFOO.so, or shr.o) is located and loaded.

The mode bit RTLD_MEMBER tells initAndLoad() that it needs to use the AIX (SVR3)
naming style.
Michael Felt <aixtools@felt.demon.nl>AIX_ABI_last_versionlibnames_num_versionlibnamenumsget_ld_headerld_header./INDEXget_ld_header_info[0-9]get_ld_headers
    Parse the header of the loader section of executable and archives
    This function calls /usr/bin/dump -H as a subprocess
    and returns a list of (ld_header, ld_header_info) tuples.
    ldr_headers/usr/bin/dump-Xuniversal_newlinesget_sharedld_headers
    extract the shareable objects from ld_headers
    character "[" is used to strip off the path information.
    Note: the "[" and "]" characters that are part of dump -H output
    are not removed here.
    sharedget_one_matchexpr
    Must be only one match, otherwise result is None.
    When there is a match, strip leading "[" and trailing "]"
    \[(rf')\]get_legacymembers
    This routine provides historical aka legacy naming schemes started
    in AIX4 shared library support for library members names.
    e.g., in /usr/lib/libc.a the member name shr.o for 32-bit binary and
    shr_64.o for 64-bit binary.
    shr4?_?64\.oshr.oshr4.oget_version
    Sort list of members and return highest numbered version - if it exists.
    This function is called when an unversioned libFOO.a(libFOO.so) has
    not been found.

    Versioning for the member name is expected to follow
    GNU LIBTOOL conventions: the highest version (x, then X.y, then X.Y.z)
     * find [libFoo.so.X]
     * find [libFoo.so.X.Y]
     * find [libFoo.so.X.Y.Z]

    Before the GNU convention became the standard scheme regardless of
    binary size AIX packagers used GNU convention "as-is" for 32-bit
    archive members but used an "distinguishing" name for 64-bit members.
    This scheme inserted either 64 or _64 between libFOO and .so
    - generally libFOO_64.so, but occasionally libFOO64.so
    lib\.so\.[0-9]+[0-9.]*_?64\.so\.[0-9]+[0-9.]*exprsget_member
    Return an archive member matching the request in name.
    Name is the library name without any prefix like lib, suffix like .so,
    or version number.
    Given a list of members find and return the most appropriate result
    Priority is given to generic libXXX.so, then a versioned libXXX.so.a.b.c

    /lib.aAIX implementation of ctypes.util.find_library()
    Find an archive member that will dlopen(). If not available,
    also search for a file (or link) with a .so suffix.

    AIX supports two types of schemes that can be used with dlopen().
    The so-called SystemV Release4 (svr4) format is commonly suffixed
    with .so while the (default) AIX scheme has the library (archive)
    ending with the suffix .a
    As an archive has multiple members (e.g., 32-bit and 64-bit) in one file
    the argument passed to dlopen must include both the library and
    the member names in a single string.

    find_library() looks first for an archive (.a) with a suitable member.
    If no archive+member pair is found, look for a .so file.

dlopen() is an interface to AIX initAndLoad() - primary documentation at:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/dlopen.htm
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/load.htm

AIX supports two styles for dlopen(): svr4 (System V Release 4) which is common on posix
platforms, but also a BSD style - aka SVR3.

From AIX 5.3 Difference Addendum (December 2004)
2.9 SVR4 linking affinity
Nowadays, there are two major object file formats used by the operating systems:
XCOFF: The COFF enhanced by IBM and others. The original COFF (Common
Object File Format) was the base of SVR3 and BSD 4.2 systems.
ELF:   Executable and Linking Format that was developed by AT&T and is a
base for SVR4 UNIX.

While the shared library content is identical on AIX - one is located as a filepath name
(svr4 style) and the other is located as a member of an archive (and the archive
is located as a filepath name).

The key difference arises when supporting multiple abi formats (i.e., 32 and 64 bit).
For svr4 either only one ABI is supported, or there are two directories, or there
are different file names. The most common solution for multiple ABI is multiple
directories.

For the XCOFF (aka AIX) style - one directory (one archive file) is sufficient
as multiple shared libraries can be in the archive - even sharing the same name.
In documentation the archive is also referred to as the "base" and the shared
library object is referred to as the "member".

For dlopen() on AIX (read initAndLoad()) the calls are similar.
Default activity occurs when no path information is provided. When path
information is provided dlopen() does not search any other directories.

For SVR4 - the shared library name is the name of the file expected: libFOO.so
For AIX - the shared library is expressed as base(member). The search is for the
base (e.g., libFOO.a) and once the base is found the shared library - identified by
member (e.g., libFOO.so, or shr.o) is located and loaded.

The mode bit RTLD_MEMBER tells initAndLoad() that it needs to use the AIX (SVR3)
naming style.

    Iterate on the list *fs*, yielding finished futures one by one in
    reverse order.
    Before yielding a future, *waiter* is removed from its waiters
    and the future is removed from each set in the collection of sets
    *ref_collect*.

    The aim of this function is to avoid keeping stale references after
    the future is yielded and before the iterator resumes.
    futures_setAn iterator over the given futures that yields each as it completes.

    Args:
        fs: The sequence of Futures (possibly created by different Executors) to
            iterate over.
        timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait. If None, then there
            is no limit on the wait time.

    Returns:
        An iterator that yields the given Futures as they complete (finished or
        cancelled). If any given Futures are duplicated, they will be returned
        once.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If the entire result iterator could not be generated
            before the given timeout.
    total_futures%d (of %d) futures unfinishedDoneAndNotDoneFuturesdone not_doneWait for the futures in the given sequence to complete.

    Args:
        fs: The sequence of Futures (possibly created by different Executors) to
            wait upon.
        timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait. If None, then there
            is no limit on the wait time.
        return_when: Indicates when this function should return. The options
            are:

            FIRST_COMPLETED - Return when any future finishes or is
                              cancelled.
            FIRST_EXCEPTION - Return when any future finishes by raising an
                              exception. If no future raises an exception
                              then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.
            ALL_COMPLETED -   Return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

    Returns:
        A named 2-tuple of sets. The first set, named 'done', contains the
        futures that completed (is finished or cancelled) before the wait
        completed. The second set, named 'not_done', contains uncompleted
        futures. Duplicate futures given to *fs* are removed and will be 
        returned only once.
    not_doneRepresents the result of an asynchronous computation.Initializes the future. Should not be called by clients.Condition_done_callbacks_invoke_callbacksexception calling callback for %r<%s at %#x state=%s raised %s><%s at %#x state=%s returned %s><%s at %#x state=%s>Cancel the future if possible.

        Returns True if the future was cancelled, False otherwise. A future
        cannot be cancelled if it is running or has already completed.
        notify_allReturn True if the future was cancelled.Return True if the future is currently executing.Return True if the future was cancelled or finished executing.__get_resultAttaches a callable that will be called when the future finishes.

        Args:
            fn: A callable that will be called with this future as its only
                argument when the future completes or is cancelled. The callable
                will always be called by a thread in the same process in which
                it was added. If the future has already completed or been
                cancelled then the callable will be called immediately. These
                callables are called in the order that they were added.
        Return the result of the call that the future represents.

        Args:
            timeout: The number of seconds to wait for the result if the future
                isn't done. If None, then there is no limit on the wait time.

        Returns:
            The result of the call that the future represents.

        Raises:
            CancelledError: If the future was cancelled.
            TimeoutError: If the future didn't finish executing before the given
                timeout.
            Exception: If the call raised then that exception will be raised.
        Return the exception raised by the call that the future represents.

        Args:
            timeout: The number of seconds to wait for the exception if the
                future isn't done. If None, then there is no limit on the wait
                time.

        Returns:
            The exception raised by the call that the future represents or None
            if the call completed without raising.

        Raises:
            CancelledError: If the future was cancelled.
            TimeoutError: If the future didn't finish executing before the given
                timeout.
        set_running_or_notify_cancelMark the future as running or process any cancel notifications.

        Should only be used by Executor implementations and unit tests.

        If the future has been cancelled (cancel() was called and returned
        True) then any threads waiting on the future completing (though calls
        to as_completed() or wait()) are notified and False is returned.

        If the future was not cancelled then it is put in the running state
        (future calls to running() will return True) and True is returned.

        This method should be called by Executor implementations before
        executing the work associated with this future. If this method returns
        False then the work should not be executed.

        Returns:
            False if the Future was cancelled, True otherwise.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: if this method was already called or if set_result()
                or set_exception() was called.
        Future %s in unexpected state: %sFuture in unexpected stateSets the return value of work associated with the future.

        Should only be used by Executor implementations and unit tests.
        {}: {!r}Sets the result of the future as being the given exception.

        Should only be used by Executor implementations and unit tests.
        This is an abstract base class for concrete asynchronous executors.submitSubmits a callable to be executed with the given arguments.

        Schedules the callable to be executed as fn(*args, **kwargs) and returns
        a Future instance representing the execution of the callable.

        Returns:
            A Future representing the given call.
        iterableschunksizeReturns an iterator equivalent to map(fn, iter).

        Args:
            fn: A callable that will take as many arguments as there are
                passed iterables.
            timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait. If None, then there
                is no limit on the wait time.
            chunksize: The size of the chunks the iterable will be broken into
                before being passed to a child process. This argument is only
                used by ProcessPoolExecutor; it is ignored by
                ThreadPoolExecutor.

        Returns:
            An iterator equivalent to: map(func, *iterables) but the calls may
            be evaluated out-of-order.

        Raises:
            TimeoutError: If the entire result iterator could not be generated
                before the given timeout.
            Exception: If fn(*args) raises for any values.
        result_iteratorcancel_futuresClean-up the resources associated with the Executor.

        It is safe to call this method several times. Otherwise, no other
        methods can be called after this one.

        Args:
            wait: If True then shutdown will not return until all running
                futures have finished executing and the resources used by the
                executor have been reclaimed.
            cancel_futures: If True then shutdown will cancel all pending
                futures. Futures that are completed or running will not be
                cancelled.
        exc_val
    Raised when a executor has become non-functional after a severe failure.

    spec_from_loader_module_repr_module_repr_from_spec<module {!r} from {!r}><module {!r}><module {!r} ({!r})>ModuleSpecThe specification for a module, used for loading.

    A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
    data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
    loader.

    `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
    to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
    package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.

    `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
    not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.

    `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
    load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
    set, origin will match.

    `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
    When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.

    `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
    corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.

    `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
    search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
    True--and False otherwise.

    Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
    has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
    system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.

    Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
    importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.

    clobbered.

    This function represents the greatest common denominator of functionality
    between import_module and __import__. This includes setting __package__ if
    the loader did not.

    _handle_fromlistFigure out what __import__ should return.

    The import_ parameter is a callable which takes the name of module to
    import. It is required to decouple the function from assuming importlib's
    import implementation is desired.

    __package__ is not guaranteed to be defined or could be set to None

    The 'globals' argument is used to infer where the import is occurring from
    to handle relative imports. The 'locals' argument is ignored. The
    'fromlist' argument specifies what should exist as attributes on the module
    being imported (e.g. ``from module import <fromlist>``).  The 'level'
    argument represents the package location to import from in a relative
    import (e.g. ``from ..pkg import mod`` would have a 'level' of 2).

    A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
    data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
    loader.

    `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
    to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
    package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.

    `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
    not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.

    `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
    load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
    set, origin will match.

    `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
    When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.

    `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
    corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.

    `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
    search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
    True--and False otherwise.

    Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
    has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
    system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.

    Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
    importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.

    A set is a finite, iterable container.

    This class provides concrete generic implementations of all

    To override the comparisons (presumably for speed, as the
    semantics are fixed), redefine __le__ and __ge__,
    then the other operations will automatically follow suit.

        Must override this method if the class constructor signature

        Note that we don't define __hash__: not all sets are hashable.
        But if you define a hashable set type, its __hash__ should
        call this function.

        This must be compatible __eq__.

        All sets ought to compare equal if they contain the same
        elements, regardless of how they are implemented, and
        regardless of the order of the elements; so there's not much
        freedom for __eq__ or __hash__.  We match the algorithm used
        by the built-in frozenset type.

This module provides classes that assist in the reading and writing
of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and implements the interface
described by PEP 305.  Although many CSV files are simple to parse,
the format is not formally defined by a stable specification and
is subtle enough that parsing lines of a CSV file with something
like line.split(",") is bound to fail.  The module supports three
basic APIs: reading, writing, and registration of dialects.


DIALECT REGISTRATION:

Readers and writers support a dialect argument, which is a convenient
handle on a group of settings.  When the dialect argument is a string,
it identifies one of the dialects previously registered with the module.
If it is a class or instance, the attributes of the argument are used as
the settings for the reader or writer:

    class excel:
        delimiter = ','
        quotechar = '"'
        escapechar = None
        doublequote = True
        skipinitialspace = False
        lineterminator = '\r\n'
        quoting = QUOTE_MINIMAL

SETTINGS:

    * quotechar - specifies a one-character string to use as the
        quoting character.  It defaults to '"'.
    * delimiter - specifies a one-character string to use as the
        field separator.  It defaults to ','.
    * skipinitialspace - specifies how to interpret whitespace which
        immediately follows a delimiter.  It defaults to False, which
        means that whitespace immediately following a delimiter is part
        of the following field.
    * lineterminator -  specifies the character sequence which should
        terminate rows.
    * quoting - controls when quotes should be generated by the writer.
        It can take on any of the following module constants:

        csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL means only when required, for example, when a
            field contains either the quotechar or the delimiter
        csv.QUOTE_ALL means that quotes are always placed around fields.
        csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC means that quotes are always placed around
            fields which do not parse as integers or floating point
            numbers.
        csv.QUOTE_NONE means that quotes are never placed around fields.
    * escapechar - specifies a one-character string used to escape
        the delimiter when quoting is set to QUOTE_NONE.
    * doublequote - controls the handling of quotes inside fields.  When
        True, two consecutive quotes are interpreted as one during read,
        and when writing, each quote character embedded in the data is
        written as two quotes

The parsing methods defined in this module implement various email related
parsing rules.  Principal among them is RFC 5322, which is the followon
to RFC 2822 and primarily a clarification of the former.  It also implements
RFC 2047 encoded word decoding.

RFC 5322 goes to considerable trouble to maintain backward compatibility with
RFC 822 in the parse phase, while cleaning up the structure on the generation
phase.  This parser supports correct RFC 5322 generation by tagging white space
as folding white space only when folding is allowed in the non-obsolete rule
sets.  Actually, the parser is even more generous when accepting input than RFC
5322 mandates, following the spirit of Postel's Law, which RFC 5322 encourages.
Where possible deviations from the standard are annotated on the 'defects'
attribute of tokens that deviate.

The general structure of the parser follows RFC 5322, and uses its terminology
where there is a direct correspondence.  Where the implementation requires a
somewhat different structure than that used by the formal grammar, new terms
that mimic the closest existing terms are used.  Thus, it really helps to have
a copy of RFC 5322 handy when studying this code.

Input to the parser is a string that has already been unfolded according to
RFC 5322 rules.  According to the RFC this unfolding is the very first step, and
this parser leaves the unfolding step to a higher level message parser, which
will have already detected the line breaks that need unfolding while
determining the beginning and end of each header.

The output of the parser is a TokenList object, which is a list subclass.  A
TokenList is a recursive data structure.  The terminal nodes of the structure
are Terminal objects, which are subclasses of str.  These do not correspond
directly to terminal objects in the formal grammar, but are instead more
practical higher level combinations of true terminals.

All TokenList and Terminal objects have a 'value' attribute, which produces the
semantically meaningful value of that part of the parse subtree.  The value of
all whitespace tokens (no matter how many sub-tokens they may contain) is a
single space, as per the RFC rules.  This includes 'CFWS', which is herein
included in the general class of whitespace tokens.  There is one exception to
the rule that whitespace tokens are collapsed into single spaces in values: in
the value of a 'bare-quoted-string' (a quoted-string with no leading or
trailing whitespace), any whitespace that appeared between the quotation marks
is preserved in the returned value.  Note that in all Terminal strings quoted
pairs are turned into their unquoted values.

All TokenList and Terminal objects also have a string value, which attempts to
be a "canonical" representation of the RFC-compliant form of the substring that
produced the parsed subtree, including minimal use of quoted pair quoting.
Whitespace runs are not collapsed.

Comment tokens also have a 'content' attribute providing the string found
between the parens (including any nested comments) with whitespace preserved.

All TokenList and Terminal objects have a 'defects' attribute which is a
possibly empty list all of the defects found while creating the token.  Defects
may appear on any token in the tree, and a composite list of all defects in the
subtree is available through the 'all_defects' attribute of any node.  (For
Terminal notes x.defects == x.all_defects.)

Each object in a parse tree is called a 'token', and each has a 'token_type'
attribute that gives the name from the RFC 5322 grammar that it represents.
Not all RFC 5322 nodes are produced, and there is one non-RFC 5322 node that
may be produced: 'ptext'.  A 'ptext' is a string of printable ascii characters.
It is returned in place of lists of (ctext/quoted-pair) and
(qtext/quoted-pair).

    This function turns a run of qcontent, ccontent-without-comments, or
    dtext-with-quoted-printables into a single string by unquoting any
    quoted printables.  It returns the string, the remaining value, and
    a flag that is True iff there were any quoted printables decoded.

    fragmentvcharshad_qpposget_fwsFWS = 1*WSP

    This isn't the RFC definition.  We're using fws to represent tokens where
    folding can be done, but when we are parsing the *un*folding has already
    been done so we don't need to watch out for CRLF.

       obs-utext = %d0 / obs-NO-WS-CTL / LF / CR

       obs-NO-WS-CTL is control characters except WSP/CR/LF.

    So, basically, we have printable runs, plus control characters or nulls in
    the obsolete syntax, separated by whitespace.  Since RFC 2047 uses the
    obsolete syntax in its specification, but requires whitespace on either
    side of the encoded words, I can see no reason to need to separate the
    non-printable-non-whitespace from the printable runs if they occur, so we
    parse this into xtext tokens separated by WSP tokens.

    Because an 'unstructured' value must by definition constitute the entire
    value, this 'get' routine does not return a remaining value, only the
    parsed TokenList.

    This is not the RFC ctext, since we are handling nested comments in comment
    and unquoting quoted-pairs here.  We allow anything except the '()'
    characters, but if we find any ASCII other than the RFC defined printable
    ASCII, a NonPrintableDefect is added to the token's defects list.  Since
    quoted pairs are converted to their unquoted values, what is returned is
    a 'ptext' token.  In this case it is a WhiteSpaceTerminal, so it's value
    is ' '.

    get_qcontentqcontent = qtext / quoted-pair

    We allow anything except the DQUOTE character, but if we find any ASCII
    other than the RFC defined printable ASCII, a NonPrintableDefect is
    added to the token's defects list.  Any quoted pairs are converted to their
    unquoted values, so what is returned is a 'ptext' token.  In this case it
    is a ValueTerminal.

    Any place we can have a dot atom, we could instead have an rfc2047 encoded
    word.
    dot_atomget_wordword = atom / quoted-string

    Either atom or quoted-string may start with CFWS.  We have to peel off this
    CFWS first to determine which type of word to parse.  Afterward we splice
    the leading CFWS, if any, into the parsed sub-token.

    If neither an atom or a quoted-string is found before the next special, a
    HeaderParseError is raised.

    The token returned is either an Atom or a QuotedString, as appropriate.
    This means the 'word' level of the formal grammar is not represented in the
    parse tree; this is because having that extra layer when manipulating the
    parse tree is more confusing than it is helpful.

    For this routine we go outside the formal grammar in order to improve error
    handling.  We recognize the end of the mailbox list only at the end of the
    value or at a ';' (the group terminator).  This is so that we can turn
    invalid mailboxes into InvalidMailbox tokens and continue parsing any
    remaining valid mailboxes.  We also allow all mailbox entries to be null,
    and this condition is handled appropriately at a higher level.

    Note that counter-intuitively, an address can be either a single address or
    a list of addresses (a group).  This is why the returned Address object has
    a 'mailboxes' attribute which treats a single address as a list of length
    one.  When you need to differentiate between to two cases, extract the single
    element, which is either a mailbox or a group token.

    We depart from the formal grammar here by continuing to parse until the end
    of the input, assuming the input to be entirely composed of an
    address-list.  This is always true in email parsing, and allows us
    to skip invalid addresses to parse additional valid ones.

    because we follow the spirit of RFC 5322.

    The RFC equivalent of ttext is any US-ASCII chars except space, ctls, or
    tspecials.  We also exclude tabs even though the RFC doesn't.

    The RFC implies the CFWS but is not explicit about it in the BNF.

    We allow any non-ATTRIBUTE_ENDS in attrtext, but add defects to the

    them, because we follow the spirit of RFC 5322.

    expected attrtext but found {!r} [CFWS] 1*attrtext [CFWS]

    This version of the BNF makes the CFWS explicit, and as usual we use a
    value terminal for the actual run of characters.  The RFC equivalent of
    attrtext is the token characters, with the subtraction of '*', "'", and '%'.
    We include tab in the excluded set just as we do for token.

    get_extended_attrtextattrtext = 1*(any non-ATTRIBUTE_ENDS character plus '%')

    This is a special parsing routine so that we get a value that
    includes % escapes as a single string (which we decode as a single
    string later).

    This is like the non-extended version except we allow % characters, so that
    we can pick up an encoded value as a single string.

    get_section '*' digits

    The formal BNF is more complicated because leading 0s are not allowed.  We
    check for that and add a defect.  We also assume no CFWS is allowed between
    the '*' and the digits, though the RFC is not crystal clear on that.
    The caller should already have dealt with leading CFWS.

    The CFWS is implied by the RFC but not made explicit in the BNF.  This
    simplified form of the BNF from the RFC is made to conform with the RFC BNF

The parsing methods defined in this module implement various email related
parsing rules.  Principal among them is RFC 5322, which is the followon
to RFC 2822 and primarily a clarification of the former.  It also implements
RFC 2047 encoded word decoding.

RFC 5322 goes to considerable trouble to maintain backward compatibility with
RFC 822 in the parse phase, while cleaning up the structure on the generation
phase.  This parser supports correct RFC 5322 generation by tagging white space
as folding white space only when folding is allowed in the non-obsolete rule
sets.  Actually, the parser is even more generous when accepting input than RFC
5322 mandates, following the spirit of Postel's Law, which RFC 5322 encourages.
Where possible deviations from the standard are annotated on the 'defects'
attribute of tokens that deviate.

The general structure of the parser follows RFC 5322, and uses its terminology
where there is a direct correspondence.  Where the implementation requires a
somewhat different structure than that used by the formal grammar, new terms
that mimic the closest existing terms are used.  Thus, it really helps to have
a copy of RFC 5322 handy when studying this code.

Input to the parser is a string that has already been unfolded according to
RFC 5322 rules.  According to the RFC this unfolding is the very first step, and
this parser leaves the unfolding step to a higher level message parser, which
will have already detected the line breaks that need unfolding while
determining the beginning and end of each header.

The output of the parser is a TokenList object, which is a list subclass.  A
TokenList is a recursive data structure.  The terminal nodes of the structure
are Terminal objects, which are subclasses of str.  These do not correspond
directly to terminal objects in the formal grammar, but are instead more
practical higher level combinations of true terminals.

All TokenList and Terminal objects have a 'value' attribute, which produces the
semantically meaningful value of that part of the parse subtree.  The value of
all whitespace tokens (no matter how many sub-tokens they may contain) is a
single space, as per the RFC rules.  This includes 'CFWS', which is herein
included in the general class of whitespace tokens.  There is one exception to
the rule that whitespace tokens are collapsed into single spaces in values: in
the value of a 'bare-quoted-string' (a quoted-string with no leading or
trailing whitespace), any whitespace that appeared between the quotation marks
is preserved in the returned value.  Note that in all Terminal strings quoted
pairs are turned into their unquoted values.

All TokenList and Terminal objects also have a string value, which attempts to
be a "canonical" representation of the RFC-compliant form of the substring that
produced the parsed subtree, including minimal use of quoted pair quoting.
Whitespace runs are not collapsed.

Comment tokens also have a 'content' attribute providing the string found
between the parens (including any nested comments) with whitespace preserved.

All TokenList and Terminal objects have a 'defects' attribute which is a
possibly empty list all of the defects found while creating the token.  Defects
may appear on any token in the tree, and a composite list of all defects in the
subtree is available through the 'all_defects' attribute of any node.  (For
Terminal notes x.defects == x.all_defects.)

Each object in a parse tree is called a 'token', and each has a 'token_type'
attribute that gives the name from the RFC 5322 grammar that it represents.
Not all RFC 5322 nodes are produced, and there is one non-RFC 5322 node that
may be produced: 'ptext'.  A 'ptext' is a string of printable ascii characters.
It is returned in place of lists of (ctext/quoted-pair) and
(qtext/quoted-pair).

       obs-NO-WS-CTL is control characters except WSP/CR/LF.

    So, basically, we have printable runs, plus control characters or nulls in
    the obsolete syntax, separated by whitespace.  Since RFC 2047 uses the
    obsolete syntax in its specification, but requires whitespace on either
    side of the encoded words, I can see no reason to need to separate the
    non-printable-non-whitespace from the printable runs if they occur, so we
    parse this into xtext tokens separated by WSP tokens.

    Because an 'unstructured' value must by definition constitute the entire
    value, this 'get' routine does not return a remaining value, only the
    parsed TokenList.

[explanation by Franois Pinard]

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
representation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', not a[k]:

                                   0

                  1                                 2

          3               4                5               6

      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30


In the tree above, each cell `k' is topping `2*k+1' and `2*k+2'.  In
a usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree
to see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications
of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.
To be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to
replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes
that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,
but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.

If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly
the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the
diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down
the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.
This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.
By iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.

A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new
items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are
not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
incoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
time.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are
scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I
used for my MIDI sequencer :-).

Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively
studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,
the speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different
than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.

Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all
know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
sequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
followed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often
very cleverly organised[1].  It is very important that the initial
sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,
and much better for input fuzzily ordered.

Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which
may not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the
heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
for progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely
vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite
effective!

In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap' module
around. :-)

--------------------
[1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the
most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
"progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)
'__about__u'Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged

Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!

A buffered reader object and buffered writer object put together to

The main difference with RawIOBase is that the read() method
supports omitting the size argument, and does not have a default
implementation that defers to readinto().

In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
return None.

A typical implementation should not inherit from a RawIOBase
implementation, but wrap one.

The
builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default
protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible
with previous versions.

Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.

The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single
bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary
writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets
this interface.

If *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try
to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python
2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
is None or smaller than 5.'clear_memodispatch_tablefastu'Pickler.memo'memou'Pickler.persistent_id'persistent_id_pickle.PicklerPickler_pickle.PicklingErroru'This takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.

The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
representation are ignored.

The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes
an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no
arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a
binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any
other custom object that meets this interface.

Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
string instances as bytes objects.'find_classu'Unpickler.memo'u'Unpickler.persistent_load'persistent_load_pickle.UnpicklerUnpickler_pickle.UnpicklingErrorUnpicklingErroru'Optimized C implementation for the Python pickle module.'u'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload/_pickle.cpython-39-darwin.so'Policy framework for the email package.

    This class is useless unless subclassed.  A subclass should define
    class attributes with defaults for any values that are to be
    managed by the Policy object.  The constructor will then allow
    non-default values to be set for these attributes at instance
    creation time.  The instance will be callable, taking these same
    attributes keyword arguments, and returning a new instance
    identical to the called instance except for those values changed
    by the keyword arguments.  Instances may be added, yielding new
    instances with any non-default values from the right hand
    operand overriding those in the left hand operand.  That is,

    The repr of an instance can be used to reconstruct the object
    if and only if the repr of the values can be used to reconstruct

        _append_docadded_doc_extend_docstringsControls for how messages are interpreted and formatted.

    Most of the classes and many of the methods in the email package accept
    Policy objects as parameters.  A Policy object contains a set of values and
    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.
    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC
    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'
    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.

    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing
    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,
    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by
    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can
    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default
    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the
    left operand.

    Settable attributes:

    raise_on_defect     -- If true, then defects should be raised as errors.
                           Default: False.

    linesep             -- string containing the value to use as separation
                           between output lines.  Default '\n'.

                           Default: 8bit.  Also controls the disposition of
                           (RFC invalid) binary data in headers; see the
                           documentation of the binary_fold method.

    max_line_length     -- maximum length of lines, excluding 'linesep',
                           during serialization.  None or 0 means no line
                           wrapping is done.  Default is 78.

    raise_on_defect8bitcte_typemangle_from_message_factoryhandle_defectdefectBased on policy, either raise defect or call register_defect.

            handle_defect(obj, defect)

        defect should be a Defect subclass, but in any case must be an
        Exception subclass.  obj is the object on which the defect should be
        registered if it is not raised.  If the raise_on_defect is True, the
        defect is raised as an error, otherwise the object and the defect are
        passed to register_defect.

        This method is intended to be called by parsers that discover defects.
        The email package parsers always call it with Defect instances.

        register_defectRecord 'defect' on 'obj'.

        Called by handle_defect if raise_on_defect is False.  This method is
        part of the Policy API so that Policy subclasses can implement custom
        defect handling.  The default implementation calls the append method of
        the defects attribute of obj.  The objects used by the email package by
        default that get passed to this method will always have a defects
        attribute with an append method.

        header_max_countReturn the maximum allowed number of headers named 'name'.

        Called when a header is added to a Message object.  If the returned
        value is not 0 or None, and there are already a number of headers with
        the name 'name' equal to the value returned, a ValueError is raised.

        Because the default behavior of Message's __setitem__ is to append the
        value to the list of headers, it is easy to create duplicate headers
        without realizing it.  This method allows certain headers to be limited
        in the number of instances of that header that may be added to a
        Message programmatically.  (The limit is not observed by the parser,
        which will faithfully produce as many headers as exist in the message
        being parsed.)

        The default implementation returns None for all header names.
        header_source_parsesourcelinesGiven a list of linesep terminated strings constituting the lines of
        a single header, return the (name, value) tuple that should be stored
        in the model.  The input lines should retain their terminating linesep
        characters.  The lines passed in by the email package may contain
        surrogateescaped binary data.
        header_store_parseGiven the header name and the value provided by the application
        program, return the (name, value) that should be stored in the model.
        header_fetch_parseGiven the header name and the value from the model, return the value
        to be returned to the application program that is requesting that
        header.  The value passed in by the email package may contain
        surrogateescaped binary data if the lines were parsed by a BytesParser.
        The returned value should not contain any surrogateescaped data.

        Given the header name and the value from the model, return a string
        containing linesep characters that implement the folding of the header
        according to the policy controls.  The value passed in by the email
        package may contain surrogateescaped binary data if the lines were
        parsed by a BytesParser.  The returned value should not contain any
        surrogateescaped data.

        fold_binaryGiven the header name and the value from the model, return binary
        data containing linesep characters that implement the folding of the
        header according to the policy controls.  The value passed in by the
        email package may contain surrogateescaped binary data.

        The name is parsed as everything up to the ':' and returned unmodified.
        The value is determined by stripping leading whitespace off the

        stripping any trailing carriage return or linefeed characters.

This is an implementation of decimal floating point arithmetic based on
the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification:

    http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

and IEEE standard 854-1987:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

Here are some examples of using the decimal module:

__xname__1.702.4.2math_mathnumbers_numbers_namedtuplesign digits exponent425000000Base exception class.

    Used exceptions derive from this.
    If an exception derives from another exception besides this (such as
    Underflow (Inexact, Rounded, Subnormal) that indicates that it is only
    called if the others are present.  This isn't actually used for
    anything, though.

    handle  -- Called when context._raise_error is called and the
               trap_enabler is not set.  First argument is self, second is the
               context.  More arguments can be given, those being after
               the explanation in _raise_error (For example,
               context._raise_error(NewError, '(-x)!', self._sign) would
               call NewError().handle(context, self._sign).)

    To define a new exception, it should be sufficient to have it derive
    from DecimalException.
    Exponent of a 0 changed to fit bounds.

    This occurs and signals clamped if the exponent of a result has been
    altered in order to fit the constraints of a specific concrete
    representation.  This may occur when the exponent of a zero result would
    be outside the bounds of a representation, or when a large normal
    number would have an encoded exponent that cannot be represented.  In
    this latter case, the exponent is reduced to fit and the corresponding
    number of zero digits are appended to the coefficient ("fold-down").
    An invalid operation was performed.

    Various bad things cause this:

    Something creates a signaling NaN
    -INF + INF
    0 * (+-)INF
    (+-)INF / (+-)INF
    x % 0
    (+-)INF % x
    x._rescale( non-integer )
    sqrt(-x) , x > 0
    0 ** 0
    x ** (non-integer)
    x ** (+-)INF
    An operand is invalid

    The result of the operation after these is a quiet positive NaN,
    except when the cause is a signaling NaN, in which case the result is
    also a quiet NaN, but with the original sign, and an optional
    diagnostic information.
    _dec_from_triple_sign_intans_fix_nan_NaNTrying to convert badly formed string.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if a string is being
    converted to a number and it does not conform to the numeric string
    syntax.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Division by 0.

    This occurs and signals division-by-zero if division of a finite number
    by zero was attempted (during a divide-integer or divide operation, or a
    power operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
    not zero.

    The result of the operation is [sign,inf], where sign is the exclusive
    or of the signs of the operands for divide, or is 1 for an odd power of
    -0, for power.
    _SignedInfinityCannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when
    the values are required to be used.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.

    If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
    permitted in the Decimal() constructor, context.create_decimal() and
    all comparison operators. Both conversion and comparisons are exact.
    Any occurrence of a mixed operation is silently recorded by setting
    FloatOperation in the context flags.  Explicit conversions with
    Decimal.from_float() or context.create_decimal_from_float() do not
    set the flag.

    Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
    conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise FloatOperation.

        Assumes that elimination of special cases has already been
        performed: self and other must both be nonspecial; self must
        be positive and not numerically equal to 1; other must be
        nonzero.  For efficiency, other._exp should not be too large,

        With two arguments, compute self**other.

        With three arguments, compute (self**other) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - other must be nonnegative
         - either self or other (or both) must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and must have at most p digits,
           where p is the context precision.

        If any of these restrictions is violated the InvalidOperation
        flag is raised.

        The result of pow(self, other, modulo) is identical to the
        result that would be obtained by computing (self**other) %
        modulo with unbounded precision, but is computed more
        efficiently.  It is always exact.

        without limiting the resulting exponent).

        canonical requires a Decimal as an argument.Compares values numerically.

        If the signs of the operands differ, a value representing each operand
        ('-1' if the operand is less than zero, '0' if the operand is zero or
        negative zero, or '1' if the operand is greater than zero) is used in
        place of that operand for the comparison instead of the actual
        operand.

        The comparison is then effected by subtracting the second operand from
        the first and then returning a value according to the result of the
        subtraction: '-1' if the result is less than zero, '0' if the result is

        Decimal('1011')
        max compares two values numerically and returns the maximum.

        If either operand is a NaN then the general rules apply.
        Otherwise, the operands are compared as though by the compare
        operation.  If they are numerically equal then the left-hand operand
        is chosen as the result.  Otherwise the maximum (closer to positive
        infinity) of the two operands is chosen as the result.

        >>> ExtendedContext.max(Decimal('3'), Decimal('2'))
        Decimal('3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(Decimal('-10'), Decimal('3'))
        Decimal('3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(Decimal('1.0'), Decimal('1'))
        Decimal('1')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(Decimal('7'), Decimal('NaN'))
        Decimal('7')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(1, 2)
        Decimal('2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(Decimal(1), 2)
        Decimal('2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max(1, Decimal(2))
        Decimal('2')
        Compares the values numerically with their sign ignored.

        >>> ExtendedContext.max_mag(Decimal('7'), Decimal('NaN'))
        Decimal('7')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max_mag(Decimal('7'), Decimal('-10'))
        Decimal('-10')

        Decimal('-2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.max_mag(1, Decimal(-2))
        Decimal('-2')
        min compares two values numerically and returns the minimum.

        If either operand is a NaN then the general rules apply.
        Otherwise, the operands are compared as though by the compare
        operation.  If they are numerically equal then the left-hand operand
        is chosen as the result.  Otherwise the minimum (closer to negative
        infinity) of the two operands is chosen as the result.

        >>> ExtendedContext.min(Decimal('3'), Decimal('2'))
        Decimal('2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.min(Decimal('-10'), Decimal('3'))
        Decimal('-10')

        >>> ExtendedContext.min_mag(1, Decimal(-2))
        Decimal('1')
        Minus corresponds to unary prefix minus in Python.

        The operation is evaluated using the same rules as subtract; the
        operation minus(a) is calculated as subtract('0', a) where the '0'
        has the same exponent as the operand.

        >>> ExtendedContext.minus(Decimal('1.3'))
        Decimal('-1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.minus(Decimal('-1.3'))
        Decimal('1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.minus(1)
        Decimal('-1')
        multiply multiplies two operands.

        If either operand is a special value then the general rules apply.
        Otherwise, the operands are multiplied together
        ('long multiplication'), resulting in a number which may be as long as
        the sum of the lengths of the two operands.

        >>> ExtendedContext.multiply(Decimal('1.20'), Decimal('3'))
        Decimal('3.60')
        >>> ExtendedContext.multiply(Decimal('7'), Decimal('3'))
        Decimal('21')
        >>> ExtendedContext.multiply(Decimal('0.9'), Decimal('0.8'))
        Decimal('0.72')

        >>> c.next_minus(1)
        Decimal('0.999999999')
        Returns the smallest representable number larger than a.

        >>> c = ExtendedContext.copy()
        >>> c.Emin = -999
        >>> c.Emax = 999

        >>> c.next_plus(1)
        Decimal('1.00000001')
        Returns the number closest to a, in direction towards b.

        The result is the closest representable number from the first
        operand (but not the first operand) that is in the direction
        towards the second operand, unless the operands have the same
        value.

        >>> c = ExtendedContext.copy()

        Decimal('1E-1007')
        normalize reduces an operand to its simplest form.

        Essentially a plus operation with all trailing zeros removed from the
        result.

        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('2.1'))
        Decimal('2.1')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('-2.0'))
        Decimal('-2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('1.200'))

        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('-120'))
        Decimal('-1.2E+2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('120.00'))
        Decimal('1.2E+2')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('0.00'))
        Decimal('0')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(6)
        Decimal('6')
        Returns an indication of the class of the operand.

        The class is one of the following strings:
          -sNaN
          -NaN
          -Infinity
          -Normal
          -Subnormal
          -Zero
          +Zero
          +Subnormal
          +Normal
          +Infinity

        >>> c = ExtendedContext.copy()

        Plus corresponds to unary prefix plus in Python.

        The operation is evaluated using the same rules as add; the
        operation plus(a) is calculated as add('0', a) where the '0'
        has the same exponent as the operand.

        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(Decimal('1.3'))
        Decimal('1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(Decimal('-1.3'))
        Decimal('-1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(-1)
        Decimal('-1')
        Raises a to the power of b, to modulo if given.

        With two arguments, compute a**b.  If a is negative then b
        must be integral.  The result will be inexact unless b is
        integral and the result is finite and can be expressed exactly
        in 'precision' digits.

        With three arguments, compute (a**b) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - b must be nonnegative
         - at least one of a or b must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and have at most 'precision' digits

        The result of pow(a, b, modulo) is identical to the result
        that would be obtained by computing (a**b) % modulo with
        unbounded precision, but is computed more efficiently.  It is
        always exact.

        >>> ExtendedContext.power(7, Decimal(7), 2)
        Decimal('1')
        Returns a value equal to 'a' (rounded), having the exponent of 'b'.

        The coefficient of the result is derived from that of the left-hand
        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

        >>> ExtendedContext.quantize(Decimal('2.17'), Decimal('0.001'))
        Decimal('2.170')

        Just returns 10, as this is Decimal, :)

        >>> ExtendedContext.radix()
        Decimal('10')
        Returns the remainder from integer division.

        The result is the residue of the dividend after the operation of
        calculating integer division as described for divide-integer, rounded
        to precision digits if necessary.  The sign of the result, if
        non-zero, is the same as that of the original dividend.

        This operation will fail under the same conditions as integer division
        (that is, if integer division on the same two operands would fail, the
        remainder cannot be calculated).

        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder(Decimal('2.1'), Decimal('3'))

        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder(22, Decimal(6))
        Decimal('4')
        Returns to be "a - b * n", where n is the integer nearest the exact
        value of "x / b" (if two integers are equally near then the even one
        is chosen).  If the result is equal to 0 then its sign will be the
        sign of a.

        This operation will fail under the same conditions as integer division
        (that is, if integer division on the same two operands would fail, the
        remainder cannot be calculated).

        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder_near(3, Decimal(11))
        Decimal('3')
        Returns a rotated copy of a, b times.

        The coefficient of the result is a rotated copy of the digits in
        the coefficient of the first operand.  The number of places of
        rotation is taken from the absolute value of the second operand,
        with the rotation being to the left if the second operand is
        positive or to the right otherwise.

        Returns a shifted copy of a, b times.

        The coefficient of the result is a shifted copy of the digits
        in the coefficient of the first operand.  The number of places
        to shift is taken from the absolute value of the second operand,
        with the shift being to the left if the second operand is
        positive or to the right otherwise.  Digits shifted into the
        coefficient are zeros.

        Convert to a string, using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

        Engineering notation has an exponent which is a multiple of 3.  This
        can leave up to 3 digits to the left of the decimal place and may
        require the addition of either one or two trailing zeros.

        The operation is not affected by the context.

        Converts a number to a string, using scientific notation.

        The operation is not affected by the context.
        Rounds to an integer.

        When the operand has a negative exponent, the result is the same
        as using the quantize() operation using the given operand as the
        left-hand-operand, 1E+0 as the right-hand-operand, and the precision
        of the operand as the precision setting; Inexact and Rounded flags
        are allowed in this operation.  The rounding mode is taken from the
        context.

    _ilogMInteger approximation to M*log(x/M), with absolute error boundable
    in terms only of x/M.

    Given positive integers x and M, return an integer approximation to
    M * log(x/M).  For L = 8 and 0.1 <= x/M <= 10 the difference
    between the approximation and the exact result is at most 22.  For
    L = 8 and 1.0 <= x/M <= 10.0 the difference is at most 15.  In
    both cases these are upper bounds on the error; it will usually be
    much smaller.RyshiftGiven integers c, e and p with c > 0, p >= 0, compute an integer

      10**(p-1) <= d <= 10**p, and
      (d-1)*10**f < exp(c*10**e) < (d+1)*10**f

    In other words, d*10**f is an approximation to exp(c*10**e) with p
    digits of precision, and with an error in d of at most 1.  This is
    almost, but not quite, the same as the error being < 1ulp: when d
    = 10**(p-1) the error could be up to 10 ulp.cshiftquotGiven integers xc, xe, yc and ye representing Decimals x = xc*10**xe and
    y = yc*10**ye, compute x**y.  Returns a pair of integers (c, e) such that:

      (c-1)*10**e < x**y < (c+1)*10**e

    in other words, c*10**e is an approximation to x**y with p digits
    of precision, and with an error in c of at most 1.  (This is
    almost, but not quite, the same as the error being < 1ulp: when c
    == 10**(p-1) we can only guarantee error < 10ulp.)

      align: alignment type, either '<', '>', '=' or '^'
      sign: either '+', '-' or ' '
      minimumwidth: nonnegative integer giving minimum width

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

So we look for cheap and easy tests that# eliminate the possibility of x**y being exact.  Only if all# these tests are passed do we go on to actually compute x**y.# Here's the main idea.  Express y as a rational number m/n, with m and# n relatively prime and n>0.  Then for x**y to be exactly# representable (at *any* precision), xc must be the nth power of a# positive integer and xe must be divisible by n.  If y is negative# then additionally xc must be a power of either 2 or 5, hence a power# of 2**n or 5**n.# There's a limit to how small |y| can be: if y=m/n as above#  (1) if xc != 1 then for the result to be representable we#      need xc**(1/n) >= 2, and hence also xc**|y| >= 2.  So#      if |y| <= 1/nbits(xc) then xc < 2**nbits(xc) <=#      2**(1/|y|), hence xc**|y| < 2 and the result is not#      representable.#  (2) if xe != 0, |xe|*(1/n) >= 1, so |xe|*|y| >= 1.  Hence if#      |y| < 1/|xe| then the result is not representable.# Note that since x is not equal to 1, at least one of (1) and# (2) must apply.  Now |y| < 1/nbits(xc) iff |yc|*nbits(xc) <# 10**-ye iff len(str(|yc|*nbits(xc)) <= -ye.# There's also a limit to how large y can be, at least if it's# positive: the normalized result will have coefficient xc**y,# so if it's representable then xc**y < 10**p, and y <# p/log10(xc).  Hence if y*log10(xc) >= p then the result is# not exactly representable.# if len(str(abs(yc*xe)) <= -ye then abs(yc*xe) < 10**-ye,# so |y| < 1/xe and the result is not representable.# Similarly, len(str(abs(yc)*xc_bits)) <= -ye implies |y|# < 1/nbits(xc).# case where xc == 1: result is 10**(xe*y), with xe*y# required to be an integer# result is now 10**(xe * 10**ye);  xe * 10**ye must be integral# if other is a nonnegative integer, use ideal exponent# case where y is negative: xc must be either a power# of 2 or a power of 5.# quick test for power of 2# now xc is a power of 2; e is its exponent# We now have:#   x = 2**e * 10**xe, e > 0, and y < 0.# The exact result is:#   x**y = 5**(-e*y) * 10**(e*y + xe*y)# provided that both e*y and xe*y are integers.

This is an implementation of decimal floating point arithmetic based on
the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification:

    http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

and IEEE standard 854-1987:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

'u'
This is an implementation of decimal floating point arithmetic based on
the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification:

    http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

and IEEE standard 854-1987:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

Here are some examples of using the decimal module:

>>> Decimal(0)
Decimal('0')
>>> Decimal('1')
Decimal('1')
>>> Decimal('-.0123')
Decimal('-0.0123')
>>> Decimal(123456)
Decimal('123456')
>>> Decimal('123.45e12345678')
Decimal('1.2345E+12345680')
>>> Decimal('1.33') + Decimal('1.27')
Decimal('2.60')
>>> Decimal('12.34') + Decimal('3.87') - Decimal('18.41')
Decimal('-2.20')

    'b'Exponent of a 0 changed to fit bounds.

    This occurs and signals clamped if the exponent of a result has been
    altered in order to fit the constraints of a specific concrete
    representation.  This may occur when the exponent of a zero result would
    be outside the bounds of a representation, or when a large normal
    number would have an encoded exponent that cannot be represented.  In
    this latter case, the exponent is reduced to fit and the corresponding
    number of zero digits are appended to the coefficient ("fold-down").

    'b'Trying to convert badly formed string.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if a string is being
    converted to a number and it does not conform to the numeric string
    syntax.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Trying to convert badly formed string.

    'b'Division by 0.

    This occurs and signals division-by-zero if division of a finite number
    by zero was attempted (during a divide-integer or divide operation, or a
    power operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
    not zero.

    The result of the operation is [sign,inf], where sign is the exclusive
    or of the signs of the operands for divide, or is 1 for an odd power of
    -0, for power.
    'u'Division by 0.

    This occurs and signals division-by-zero if division of a finite number
    by zero was attempted (during a divide-integer or divide operation, or a
    power operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
    not zero.

    The result of the operation is [sign,inf], where sign is the exclusive
    or of the signs of the operands for divide, or is 1 for an odd power of
    -0, for power.
    'b'Cannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Cannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'b'Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'b'Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    'u'Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    'b'Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when
    the values are required to be used.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when

    'b'Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    'u'Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    'b'Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    'u'Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    'b'Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    'u'Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide

    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    'b'Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    'u'Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    'b'Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.

    If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
    permitted in the Decimal() constructor, context.create_decimal() and
    all comparison operators. Both conversion and comparisons are exact.
    Any occurrence of a mixed operation is silently recorded by setting
    FloatOperation in the context flags.  Explicit conversions with
    Decimal.from_float() or context.create_decimal_from_float() do not
    set the flag.

    Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
    conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise FloatOperation.

        'b'Plus corresponds to unary prefix plus in Python.

        The operation is evaluated using the same rules as add; the

        'b'Raises a to the power of b, to modulo if given.

        With two arguments, compute a**b.  If a is negative then b
        must be integral.  The result will be inexact unless b is
        integral and the result is finite and can be expressed exactly
        in 'precision' digits.

        With three arguments, compute (a**b) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - b must be nonnegative
         - at least one of a or b must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and have at most 'precision' digits

        The result of pow(a, b, modulo) is identical to the result
        that would be obtained by computing (a**b) % modulo with
        unbounded precision, but is computed more efficiently.  It is
        always exact.

        'b'Returns a value equal to 'a' (rounded), having the exponent of 'b'.

        The coefficient of the result is derived from that of the left-hand
        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.

socket(family=-1, type=-1, proto=-1, fileno=None) -> socket object

Open a socket of the given type.  The family argument specifies the
address family; it defaults to AF_INET.  The type argument specifies
whether this is a stream (SOCK_STREAM, this is the default)
or datagram (SOCK_DGRAM) socket.  The protocol argument defaults to 0,
specifying the default protocol.  Keyword arguments are accepted.
The socket is created as non-inheritable.

When a fileno is passed in, family, type and proto are auto-detected,
unless they are explicitly set.

A socket object represents one endpoint of a network connection.

Methods of socket objects (keyword arguments not allowed):

_accept() -- accept connection, returning new socket fd and client address
bind(addr) -- bind the socket to a local address
close() -- close the socket
connect(addr) -- connect the socket to a remote address
connect_ex(addr) -- connect, return an error code instead of an exception
dup() -- return a new socket fd duplicated from fileno()
fileno() -- return underlying file descriptor
getpeername() -- return remote address [*]
getsockname() -- return local address
getsockopt(level, optname[, buflen]) -- get socket options
gettimeout() -- return timeout or None
listen([n]) -- start listening for incoming connections
recv(buflen[, flags]) -- receive data
recv_into(buffer[, nbytes[, flags]]) -- receive data (into a buffer)
recvfrom(buflen[, flags]) -- receive data and sender's address
recvfrom_into(buffer[, nbytes, [, flags])
  -- receive data and sender's address (into a buffer)
sendall(data[, flags]) -- send all data
send(data[, flags]) -- send data, may not send all of it
sendto(data[, flags], addr) -- send data to a given address
setblocking(bool) -- set or clear the blocking I/O flag
getblocking() -- return True if socket is blocking, False if non-blocking
setsockopt(level, optname, value[, optlen]) -- set socket options
settimeout(None | float) -- set or clear the timeout
shutdown(how) -- shut down traffic in one or both directions

Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

(Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local
 class.  Depending on the version of Python you're using, there may be a
 faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
 `threading`.)

Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
a thread-local object and use its attributes:

  >>> mydata = local()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.number
  42

You can also access the local-object's dictionary:

  >>> mydata.__dict__
  {'number': 42}
  >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
  []
  >>> mydata.widgets
  []

What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> def f():
  ...     items = sorted(mydata.__dict__.items())
  ...     log.append(items)
  ...     mydata.number = 11
  ...     log.append(mydata.number)

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[], 11]

we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
don't affect data seen in this thread:

  >>> mydata.number
  42

Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
came from.

You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     number = 2
  ...     def __init__(self, /, **kw):
  ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
  ...     def squared(self):
  ...         return self.number ** 2

This can be useful to support default values, methods and
initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.

Now if we create a local object:

  >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')

Now we have a default number:

  >>> mydata.number
  2

an initial color:

  >>> mydata.color
  'red'
  >>> del mydata.color

And a method that operates on the data:

  >>> mydata.squared()
  4

As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[('color', 'red')], 11]

without affecting this thread's data:

  >>> mydata.number
  2
  >>> mydata.color
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'

Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
local. They are shared across threads:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     __slots__ = 'number'

  >>> mydata = MyLocal()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.color = 'red'

So, the separate thread:

  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()

    For example, this yaml document still has duplicate keys, but does not

        foo: second
        bar: {second: bar}
        baz: 42


    Limitations
    -----------

    Aggregation is permitted between tagged objects that share the same type.
    If not, the default merge strategy prevails.

    For example, these examples:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        foo: {first: value}

        baz: [fail]

        qux: 42
        qux: !aggr-scalar fail

    are interpreted like this:

    .. code-block:: yaml

    .. versionchanged:: 3005

        preference to install rpm packages are to use in the following order:
            /opt/freeware/bin/dnf
            /opt/freeware/bin/yum
            /usr/bin/yum
            /usr/bin/rpm

    .. note:
        use of rpm to install implies that rpm's dependencies must have been previously installed.
        dnf and yum automatically install rpm's dependencies as part of the install process

        Alogrithm to install filesets or rpms is as follows:
            if ends with '.rte' or '.bff'
                process as fileset
            if ends with '.rpm'
                process as rpm
            if unrecognised or no file extension
                attempt process with dnf | yum
                failure implies attempt process as fileset

        Fileset needs to be available as a single path and filename
        compound filesets are not handled and are not supported.
        An example is bos.adt.insttools which is part of bos.adt.other and is installed as follows
        /usr/bin/installp -acXYg /cecc/repos/aix72/TL4/BASE/installp/ppc/bos.adt.other bos.adt.insttools

    name
        The name of the fileset or rpm package to be installed.

    refresh

    pkgs
        A list of filesets and/or rpm packages to install.
        Must be passed as a python list. The ``name`` parameter will be
        ignored if this option is passed.

    version
        Install a specific version of a fileset/rpm package.
        (Unused at present).

    test
        Verify that command functions correctly.

    Returns a dict containing the new fileset(s)/rpm package(s) names and versions:

        {'<package>': {'old': '<old-version>',
                       'new': '<new-version>'}}

            if ends with '.rte' or '.bff'
                process as fileset
            if ends with '.rpm'

Support for Apache

.. note::
    The functions in here are generic functions designed to work with
    all implementations of Apache. Debian-specific functions have been moved into
    deb_apache.py, but will still load under the ``apache`` namespace when a
    Debian-based system is detected.

    Only load the module if apache is installed
    _detect_osapacheThe apache execution module cannot be loaded: apache is not installed.
    Apache commands and paths differ depending on packaging
    apachectlapache2ctl
    Return server version (``apachectl -v``)

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' apache.version
     -vfullversion
    Return server version (``apachectl -V``)

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' apache.fullversion
     -Vcompiled_with^\s+-D\s+define_re -Dcwith
    Return list of static and shared modules (``apachectl -M``)

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' apache.modules
     -M(static)(shared)servermods
    Return list of modules compiled into the server (``apachectl -l``)

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' apache.servermods
     -l.cdirectives
    Return list of directives together with expected arguments
    and places where the directive is valid (``apachectl -L``)

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' apache.directives
     -Lvhosts
    Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently
    only shows the virtualhost settings) (``apachectl -S``).
    Because each additional virtual host adds to the execution
    time, this command may require a long timeout be specified
    by using ``-t 10``.

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt -t 10 '*' apache.vhosts
     -Snamevhostis a NameVirtualHostvhost\(|\)
    Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop.

        n  Don't update file; display results on stdout.
        m  Force MD5 hashing of the password (default).
        d  Force CRYPT(3) hashing of the password.
        p  Do not hash the password (plaintext).
        s  Force SHA1 hashing of the password.

    The following configuration needs to exists in pillar/grains.
    Each entry nested in ``apache.server-status`` is a profile of a vhost/server.
    This would give support for multiple apache servers/vhosts.

    Get Information from the Apache server-status handler

    .. note::

        The server-status handler is disabled by default.
        In order for this function to work it needs to be enabled.
        See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html

    The following configuration needs to exists in pillar/grains.
    Each entry nested in ``apache.server-status`` is a profile of a vhost/server.
    This would give support for multiple apache servers/vhosts.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        apache.server-status:
          default:
            url: http://localhost/server-status

            pass: password
            realm: 'authentication realm for digest passwords'

A REST API for Salt
===================

.. py:currentmodule:: salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app

.. note::

    This module is Experimental on Windows platforms and supports limited
    configurations:

    - doesn't support PAM authentication (i.e. external_auth: auto)
    - doesn't support SSL (i.e. disable_ssl: True)

:depends:
    - CherryPy Python module.

      Note: there is a `known SSL traceback for CherryPy versions 3.2.5 through
      3.7.x <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/1298>`_. Please use
      version 3.2.3 or the latest 10.x version instead.
:optdepends:    - ws4py Python module for websockets support.
:client_libraries:
    - Java: https://github.com/SUSE/salt-netapi-client
    - Python: https://github.com/saltstack/pepper
:setup:
    All steps below are performed on the machine running the Salt Master
    daemon. Configuration goes into the Master configuration file.

    1.  Install ``salt-api``. (This step varies between OS and Linux distros.
        Some package systems have a split package, others include salt-api in
        the main Salt package. Ensure the ``salt-api --version`` output matches
        the ``salt --version`` output.)
    2.  Install CherryPy. (Read the version caveat in the section above.)
    3.  Optional: generate self-signed SSL certificates.

        Using a secure HTTPS connection is strongly recommended since Salt
        eauth authentication credentials will be sent over the wire.

        1.  Install the PyOpenSSL package.
        2.  Generate a self-signed certificate using the
            :py:func:`~salt.modules.tls.create_self_signed_cert` execution
            function.

            .. code-block:: bash

                salt-call --local tls.create_self_signed_cert

    4.  Edit the master config to create at least one external auth user or
        group following the :ref:`full external auth instructions <acl-eauth>`.
    5.  Edit the master config with the following production-ready example to
        enable the ``rest_cherrypy`` module. (Adjust cert paths as needed, or
        disable SSL (not recommended!).)

        .. code-block:: yaml

            rest_cherrypy:
              port: 8000
              ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
              ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key

    6.  Restart the ``salt-master`` daemon.
    7.  Start the ``salt-api`` daemon.

:configuration:
    All available configuration options are detailed below. These settings
    configure the CherryPy HTTP server and do not apply when using an external
    server such as Apache or Nginx.

    port
        **Required**

        The port for the webserver to listen on.
    host : ``0.0.0.0``
        The socket interface for the HTTP server to listen on.
    debug : ``False``
        Starts the web server in development mode. It will reload itself when
        the underlying code is changed and will output more debugging info.
    log_access_file
        Path to a file to write HTTP access logs.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    log_error_file
        Path to a file to write HTTP error logs.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    ssl_crt
        The path to a SSL certificate. (See below)
    ssl_key
        The path to the private key for your SSL certificate. (See below)
    ssl_chain
        (Optional when using PyOpenSSL) the certificate chain to pass to
        ``Context.load_verify_locations``.
    disable_ssl
        A flag to disable SSL. Warning: your Salt authentication credentials
        will be sent in the clear!
    webhook_disable_auth : False
        The :py:class:`Webhook` URL requires authentication by default but
        external services cannot always be configured to send authentication.
        See the Webhook documentation for suggestions on securing this
        interface.
    webhook_url : /hook
        Configure the URL endpoint for the :py:class:`Webhook` entry point.
    thread_pool : ``100``
        The number of worker threads to start up in the pool.
    socket_queue_size : ``30``
        Specify the maximum number of HTTP connections to queue.
    expire_responses : True
        Whether to check for and kill HTTP responses that have exceeded the
        default timeout.

        .. deprecated:: 2016.11.9,2017.7.3,2018.3.0

            The "expire_responses" configuration setting, which corresponds
            to the ``timeout_monitor`` setting in CherryPy, is no longer
            supported in CherryPy versions >= 12.0.0.

    max_request_body_size : ``1048576``
        Maximum size for the HTTP request body.
    collect_stats : False
        Collect and report statistics about the CherryPy server

        Reports are available via the :py:class:`Stats` URL.
    stats_disable_auth : False
        Do not require authentication to access the ``/stats`` endpoint.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0
    static
        A filesystem path to static HTML/JavaScript/CSS/image assets.
    static_path : ``/static``
        The URL prefix to use when serving static assets out of the directory
        specified in the ``static`` setting.
    enable_sessions : ``True``
        Enable or disable all endpoints that rely on session cookies. This can
        be useful to enforce only header-based authentication.

        .. versionadded:: 2017.7.0

    app : ``index.html``
        A filesystem path to an HTML file that will be served as a static file.
        This is useful for bootstrapping a single-page JavaScript app.

        Warning! If you set this option to a custom web application, anything
        that uses cookie-based authentication is vulnerable to XSRF attacks.
        Send the custom ``X-Auth-Token`` header instead and consider disabling
        the ``enable_sessions`` setting.

        .. versionchanged:: 2017.7.0

            Add a proof-of-concept JavaScript single-page app.

    app_path : ``/app``
        The URL prefix to use for serving the HTML file specified in the ``app``
        setting. This should be a simple name containing no slashes.

        Any path information after the specified path is ignored; this is
        useful for apps that utilize the HTML5 history API.
    root_prefix : ``/``
        A URL path to the main entry point for the application. This is useful
        for serving multiple applications from the same URL.

.. _rest_cherrypy-auth:

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is performed by passing a session token with each request.
Tokens are generated via the :py:class:`Login` URL.

The token may be sent in one of two ways: as a custom header or as a session
cookie. The latter is far more convenient for clients that support cookies.

* Include a custom header named :mailheader:`X-Auth-Token`.

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -d username=saltdev \
          -d password=saltdev \
          -d eauth=pam

  Copy the ``token`` value from the output and include it in subsequent requests:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -H 'X-Auth-Token: 697adbdc8fe971d09ae4c2a3add7248859c87079'\
          -d client=local \
          -d tgt='*' \
          -d fun=test.ping

* Sent via a cookie. This option is a convenience for HTTP clients that
  automatically handle cookie support (such as browsers).

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      # Write the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
            -c ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d username=saltdev \
            -d password=saltdev \
            -d eauth=auto

      # Read the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
            -b ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d client=local \
            -d tgt='*' \
            -d fun=test.ping

  Another example using the :program:`requests` library in Python:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> import requests
      >>> session = requests.Session()
      >>> session.post('http://localhost:8000/login', json={
          'username': 'saltdev',
          'password': 'saltdev',
          'eauth': 'auto',
      })
      <Response [200]>
      >>> resp = session.post('http://localhost:8000', json=[{
          'client': 'local',
          'tgt': '*',
          'fun': 'test.arg',
          'arg': ['foo', 'bar'],
          'kwarg': {'baz': 'Baz!'},
      }])
      >>> resp.json()
      {u'return': [{
          ...snip...
      }]}

.. seealso:: You can bypass the session handling via the :py:class:`Run` URL.

Usage
-----

This interface directly exposes Salt's :ref:`Python API <python-api>`.
Everything possible at the CLI is possible through the Python API. Commands are
executed on the Salt Master.

The root URL (``/``) is RPC-like in that it accepts instructions in the request
body for what Salt functions to execute, and the response contains the result
of those function calls.

For example:

.. code-block:: text

    % curl -sSi https://localhost:8000         -H 'Content-type: application/json'         -d '[{
            "client": "local",
            "tgt": "*",
            "fun": "test.ping"
        }]'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    [...snip...]

    {"return": [{"jerry": true}]}

The request body must be an array of commands. Use this workflow to build a
command:

1.  Choose a client interface.
2.  Choose a function.
3.  Fill out the remaining parameters needed for the chosen client.

The ``client`` field is a reference to the main Python classes used in Salt's
Python API. Read the full :ref:`Client APIs <client-apis>` documentation, but
in short:

* "local" uses :py:class:`LocalClient <salt.client.LocalClient>` which sends
  commands to Minions. Equivalent to the ``salt`` CLI command.
* "runner" uses :py:class:`RunnerClient <salt.r...Pipeparse_qslsalt.netapicherrypy.libcpstatsImport of cherrypy.cpstats failed.

    urlencoded_processor
    Accept x-www-form-urlencoded data and reformat it into a Low State
    data structure.

    Since we can't easily represent complicated data structures with
    key-value pairs, any more complicated requirements (e.g. compound
    commands) must instead be delivered via JSON or YAML.

    For example::

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -si localhost:8000 -d client=local -d tgt='*' \
                -d fun='test.kwarg' -d arg='one=1' -d arg='two=2'

    :param entity: raw POST data
    urlencodedraw_bodyunserialized_datayamlify_argjson_processor
    Unserialize raw POST data in JSON format to a Python data structure.

    :param entity: raw POST data
    fp_outInvalid JSON documentyaml_processor
    Unserialize raw POST data in YAML format to a Python data structure.

    :param entity: raw POST data
    Invalid YAML documenttext_processor
    Attempt to unserialize plain text as JSON

    Some large services still send JSON with a text/plain Content-Type. Those
    services are bad and should feel bad.

    :param entity: raw POST data
    hypermedia_in
    Unserialize POST/PUT data of a specified Content-Type.

    The following custom processors all are intended to format Low State data
    and will place that data structure into the request object.

    salt-api does not enforce authorization, Salt's eauth system does that.
    Local/Runner/WheelClient all accept ``username``/``password``/``eauth``
    **or** ``token`` kwargs that are then checked by the eauth system. The
    session mechanism in ``rest_cherrypy`` simply pairs a session with a Salt
    eauth token and then passes the ``token`` kwarg in automatically.

    If you already have a Salt eauth token, perhaps generated by the
    :py:func:`mk_token <salt.runners.auth.mk_token>` function in the Auth
    Runner module, then there is no reason to use sessions.

    This endpoint accepts either a ``username``, ``password``, ``eauth`` trio,
    **or** a ``token`` kwarg and does not make use of sessions at all.

        **Example response:**

        Note, the ``tag`` field is not part of the spec. SSE compliant clients
        should ignore unknown fields. This addition allows non-compliant

        JSON object each time.

        The event stream can be easily consumed via JavaScript:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events');
            source.onopen = function() { console.info('Listening ...') };
            source.onerror = function(err) { console.error(err) };
            source.onmessage = function(message) {
                var saltEvent = JSON.parse(message.data);
                console.log(saltEvent.tag, saltEvent.data);
            };

        Note, the SSE stream is fast and completely asynchronous and Salt is
        very fast. If a job is created using a regular POST request, it is
        possible that the job return will be available on the SSE stream before
        the response for the POST request arrives. It is important to take that
        asynchronicity into account when designing an application. Below are
        some general guidelines.

        * Subscribe to the SSE stream _before_ creating any events.
        * Process SSE events directly as they arrive and don't wait for any
          other process to "complete" first (like an ajax request).
        * Keep a buffer of events if the event stream must be used for
          synchronous lookups.
        * Be cautious in writing Salt's event stream directly to the DOM. It is
          very busy and can quickly overwhelm the memory allocated to a
          browser tab.

        A full, working proof-of-concept JavaScript application is available
        :blob:`adjacent to this file <salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/index.html>`.
        It can be viewed by pointing a browser at the ``/app`` endpoint in a
        running ``rest_cherrypy`` instance.

        Or using CORS:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events?token=ecd589e4e01912cf3c4035afad73426dbb8dba75', {withCredentials: true});

        It is also possible to consume the stream via the shell.

        Records are separated by blank lines; the ``data:`` and ``tag:``
        prefixes will need to be removed manually before attempting to
        unserialize the JSON.

        curl's ``-N`` flag turns off input buffering which is required to
        process the stream incrementally.

        Here is a basic example of printing each event as it comes in:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    while IFS= read -r line ; do
                        echo $line
                    done

        Here is an example of using awk to filter events based on tag:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    awk '
                        BEGIN { RS=""; FS="\\n" }
                        $1 ~ /^tag: salt\/job\/[0-9]+\/new$/ { print $0 }

            source.send('websocket client ready')

            source.close();

        Or via Python, using the Python module `websocket-client
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/>`_ for example.

        .. code-block:: python

            # Note, you must be authenticated!

        This URL requires authentication however not all external services can
        be configured to authenticate. For this reason authentication can be
        selectively disabled for this URL. Follow best practices -- always use
        SSL, pass a secret key, configure the firewall to only allow traffic
        from a known source, etc.

    The event data is taken from the request body. The
    :mailheader:`Content-Type` header is respected for the payload.

    The event tag is prefixed with ``salt/netapi/hook`` and the URL path is
    appended to the end. For example, a ``POST`` request sent to
    ``/hook/mycompany/myapp/mydata`` will produce a Salt event with the tag
    ``salt/netapi/hook/mycompany/myapp/mydata``.

    The following is an example ``.travis.yml`` file to send notifications to
    Salt of successful test runs:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        language: python
        script: python -m unittest tests
        after_success:
            - |
                curl -sSk https://saltapi-url.example.com:8000/hook/travis/build/success                         -d branch="${TRAVIS_BRANCH}"                         -d commit="${TRAVIS_COMMIT}"

    .. seealso:: :ref:`events`, :ref:`reactor <reactor>`
    tag_basewebhook_disable_auth
        Fire an event in Salt with a custom event tag and data

        .. http:post:: /hook

            :status 200: |200|
            :status 401: |401|
            :status 406: |406|
            :status 413: request body is too large

        **Example request:**

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -sS localhost:8000/hook \
                -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
                -d '{"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}'

        .. code-block:: text

            POST /hook HTTP/1.1
            Host: localhost:8000
            Content-Length: 16
            Content-Type: application/json

            {"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}

        **Example response**:

        .. code-block:: text

            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Content-Length: 14
            Content-Type: application/json

            {"success": true}

        As a practical example, an internal continuous-integration build
        server could send an HTTP POST request to the URL
        ``https://localhost:8000/hook/mycompany/build/success`` which contains
        the result of a build and the SHA of the version that was built as
        JSON. That would then produce the following event in Salt that could be
        used to kick off a deployment via Salt's Reactor::

            Event fired at Fri Feb 14 17:40:11 2014
            *************************
            Tag: salt/netapi/hook/mycompany/build/success
            Data:
            {'_stamp': '2014-02-14_17:40:11.440996',
                'headers': {
                    'X-My-Secret-Key': 'F0fAgoQjIT@W',
                    'Content-Length': '37',
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',

                'post': {'revision': 'aa22a3c4b2e7', 'result': True}}

        Salt's Reactor could listen for the event:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            reactor:
              - 'salt/netapi/hook/mycompany/build/*':
                - /srv/reactor/react_ci_builds.sls

        And finally deploy the new build:

        .. code-block:: jinja

            {% set secret_key = data.get('headers', {}).get('X-My-Secret-Key') %}
            {% set build = data.get('post', {}) %}

            {% if secret_key == 'F0fAgoQjIT@W' and build.result == True %}
            deploy_my_app:
              cmd.state.sls:
                - tgt: 'application*'

A REST API for Salt
===================

.. py:currentmodule:: salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app

.. note::

    This module is Experimental on Windows platforms and supports limited
    configurations:

    - doesn't support PAM authentication (i.e. external_auth: auto)
    - doesn't support SSL (i.e. disable_ssl: True)

:depends:
    - CherryPy Python module.

      Note: there is a `known SSL traceback for CherryPy versions 3.2.5 through
      3.7.x <https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/1298>`_. Please use
      version 3.2.3 or the latest 10.x version instead.
:optdepends:    - ws4py Python module for websockets support.
:client_libraries:
    - Java: https://github.com/SUSE/salt-netapi-client
    - Python: https://github.com/saltstack/pepper
:setup:
    All steps below are performed on the machine running the Salt Master
    daemon. Configuration goes into the Master configuration file.

    1.  Install ``salt-api``. (This step varies between OS and Linux distros.
        Some package systems have a split package, others include salt-api in
        the main Salt package. Ensure the ``salt-api --version`` output matches
        the ``salt --version`` output.)
    2.  Install CherryPy. (Read the version caveat in the section above.)
    3.  Optional: generate self-signed SSL certificates.

        Using a secure HTTPS connection is strongly recommended since Salt
        eauth authentication credentials will be sent over the wire.

        1.  Install the PyOpenSSL package.
        2.  Generate a self-signed certificate using the
            :py:func:`~salt.modules.tls.create_self_signed_cert` execution
            function.

            .. code-block:: bash

                salt-call --local tls.create_self_signed_cert

    4.  Edit the master config to create at least one external auth user or
        group following the :ref:`full external auth instructions <acl-eauth>`.
    5.  Edit the master config with the following production-ready example to
        enable the ``rest_cherrypy`` module. (Adjust cert paths as needed, or
        disable SSL (not recommended!).)

        .. code-block:: yaml

            rest_cherrypy:
              port: 8000
              ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
              ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key

    6.  Restart the ``salt-master`` daemon.
    7.  Start the ``salt-api`` daemon.

:configuration:
    All available configuration options are detailed below. These settings
    configure the CherryPy HTTP server and do not apply when using an external
    server such as Apache or Nginx.

    port
        **Required**

        The port for the webserver to listen on.
    host : ``0.0.0.0``
        The socket interface for the HTTP server to listen on.
    debug : ``False``
        Starts the web server in development mode. It will reload itself when
        the underlying code is changed and will output more debugging info.
    log_access_file
        Path to a file to write HTTP access logs.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    log_error_file
        Path to a file to write HTTP error logs.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    ssl_crt
        The path to a SSL certificate. (See below)
    ssl_key
        The path to the private key for your SSL certificate. (See below)
    ssl_chain
        (Optional when using PyOpenSSL) the certificate chain to pass to
        ``Context.load_verify_locations``.
    disable_ssl
        A flag to disable SSL. Warning: your Salt authentication credentials
        will be sent in the clear!
    webhook_disable_auth : False
        The :py:class:`Webhook` URL requires authentication by default but
        external services cannot always be configured to send authentication.
        See the Webhook documentation for suggestions on securing this
        interface.
    webhook_url : /hook
        Configure the URL endpoint for the :py:class:`Webhook` entry point.
    thread_pool : ``100``
        The number of worker threads to start up in the pool.
    socket_queue_size : ``30``
        Specify the maximum number of HTTP connections to queue.
    expire_responses : True
        Whether to check for and kill HTTP responses that have exceeded the
        default timeout.

        .. deprecated:: 2016.11.9,2017.7.3,2018.3.0

            The "expire_responses" configuration setting, which corresponds
            to the ``timeout_monitor`` setting in CherryPy, is no longer
            supported in CherryPy versions >= 12.0.0.

    max_request_body_size : ``1048576``
        Maximum size for the HTTP request body.
    collect_stats : False
        Collect and report statistics about the CherryPy server

        Reports are available via the :py:class:`Stats` URL.
    stats_disable_auth : False
        Do not require authentication to access the ``/stats`` endpoint.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0
    static
        A filesystem path to static HTML/JavaScript/CSS/image assets.
    static_path : ``/static``
        The URL prefix to use when serving static assets out of the directory
        specified in the ``static`` setting.
    enable_sessions : ``True``
        Enable or disable all endpoints that rely on session cookies. This can
        be useful to enforce only header-based authentication.

        .. versionadded:: 2017.7.0

    app : ``index.html``
        A filesystem path to an HTML file that will be served as a static file.
        This is useful for bootstrapping a single-page JavaScript app.

        Warning! If you set this option to a custom web application, anything
        that uses cookie-based authentication is vulnerable to XSRF attacks.
        Send the custom ``X-Auth-Token`` header instead and consider disabling
        the ``enable_sessions`` setting.

        .. versionchanged:: 2017.7.0

            Add a proof-of-concept JavaScript single-page app.

    app_path : ``/app``
        The URL prefix to use for serving the HTML file specified in the ``app``
        setting. This should be a simple name containing no slashes.

        Any path information after the specified path is ignored; this is
        useful for apps that utilize the HTML5 history API.
    root_prefix : ``/``
        A URL path to the main entry point for the application. This is useful
        for serving multiple applications from the same URL.

.. _rest_cherrypy-auth:

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is performed by passing a session token with each request.
Tokens are generated via the :py:class:`Login` URL.

The token may be sent in one of two ways: as a custom header or as a session
cookie. The latter is far more convenient for clients that support cookies.

* Include a custom header named :mailheader:`X-Auth-Token`.

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -d username=saltdev \
          -d password=saltdev \
          -d eauth=pam

  Copy the ``token`` value from the output and include it in subsequent requests:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -H 'X-Auth-Token: 697adbdc8fe971d09ae4c2a3add7248859c87079'\
          -d client=local \
          -d tgt='*' \
          -d fun=test.ping

* Sent via a cookie. This option is a convenience for HTTP clients that
  automatically handle cookie support (such as browsers).

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      # Write the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
            -c ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d username=saltdev \
            -d password=saltdev \
            -d eauth=auto

      # Read the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
            -b ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d client=local \
            -d tgt='*' \
            -d fun=test.ping

  Another example using the :program:`requests` library in Python:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> import requests
      >>> session = requests.Session()
      >>> session.post('http://localhost:8000/login', json={
          'username': 'saltdev',
          'password': 'saltdev',
          'eauth': 'auto',
      })
      <Response [200]>
      >>> resp = session.post('http://localhost:8000', json=[{
          'client': 'local',
          'tgt': '*',
          'fun': 'test.arg',
          'arg': ['foo', 'bar'],
          'kwarg': {'baz': 'Baz!'},
      }])
      >>> resp.json()
      {u'return': [{
          ...snip...
      }]}

.. seealso:: You can bypass the session handling via the :py:class:`Run` URL.

Usage
-----

This interface directly exposes Salt's :ref:`Python API <python-api>`.
Everything possible at the CLI is possible through the Python API. Commands are
executed on the Salt Master.

The root URL (``/``) is RPC-like in that it accepts instructions in the request
body for what Salt functions to execute, and the response contains the result
of those function calls.

For example:

.. code-block:: text

    % curl -sSi https://localhost:8000         -H 'Content-type: application/json'         -d '[{
            "client": "local",
            "tgt": "*",
            "fun": "test.ping"
        }]'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    [...snip...]

    {"return": [{"jerry": true}]}

The request body must be an array of commands. Use this workflow to build a
command:

1.  Choose a client interface.
2.  Choose a function.
3.  Fill out the remaining parameters needed for the chosen client.

The ``client`` field is a reference to the main Python classes used in Salt's
Python API. Read the full :ref:`Client APIs <client-apis>` documentation, but
in short:

* "local" uses :py:class:`LocalClient <salt.client.LocalClient>` which sends
  commands to Minions. Equivalent to the ``salt`` CLI command.
* "runner" uses :py:class:`RunnerClient <salt...u'

        A filesystem path to static HTML/JavaScript/CSS/image assets.
    static_path : ``/static``
        The URL prefix to use when serving static assets out of the directory
        specified in the ``static`` setting.
    enable_sessions : ``True``
        Enable or disable all endpoints that rely on session cookies. This can
        be useful to enforce only header-based authentication.

        .. versionadded:: 2017.7.0

    app : ``index.html``
        A filesystem path to an HTML file that will be served as a static file.
        This is useful for bootstrapping a single-page JavaScript app.

        Warning! If you set this option to a custom web application, anything
        that uses cookie-based authentication is vulnerable to XSRF attacks.
        Send the custom ``X-Auth-Token`` header instead and consider disabling
        the ``enable_sessions`` setting.

        .. versionchanged:: 2017.7.0

            Add a proof-of-concept JavaScript single-page app.

    app_path : ``/app``
        The URL prefix to use for serving the HTML file specified in the ``app``
        setting. This should be a simple name containing no slashes.

        Any path information after the specified path is ignored; this is
        useful for apps that utilize the HTML5 history API.
    root_prefix : ``/``
        A URL path to the main entry point for the application. This is useful
        for serving multiple applications from the same URL.

.. _rest_cherrypy-auth:

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is performed by passing a session token with each request.
Tokens are generated via the :py:class:`Login` URL.

The token may be sent in one of two ways: as a custom header or as a session
cookie. The latter is far more convenient for clients that support cookies.

* Include a custom header named :mailheader:`X-Auth-Token`.

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -d username=saltdev \
          -d password=saltdev \
          -d eauth=pam

  Copy the ``token`` value from the output and include it in subsequent requests:

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
          -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
          -H 'X-Auth-Token: 697adbdc8fe971d09ae4c2a3add7248859c87079'\
          -d client=local \
          -d tgt='*' \
          -d fun=test.ping

* Sent via a cookie. This option is a convenience for HTTP clients that
  automatically handle cookie support (such as browsers).

  For example, using curl:

  .. code-block:: bash

      # Write the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login \
            -c ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d username=saltdev \
            -d password=saltdev \
            -d eauth=auto

      # Read the cookie file:
      curl -sSk https://localhost:8000 \
            -b ~/cookies.txt \
            -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
            -d client=local \
            -d tgt='*' \
            -d fun=test.ping

  Another example using the :program:`requests` library in Python:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> import requests
      >>> session = requests.Session()
      >>> session.post('http://localhost:8000/login', json={
          'username': 'saltdev',
          'password': 'saltdev',
          'eauth': 'auto',
      })
      <Response [200]>
      >>> resp = session.post('http://localhost:8000', json=[{
          'client': 'local',
          'tgt': '*',
          'fun': 'test.arg',
          'arg': ['foo', 'bar'],
          'kwarg': {'baz': 'Baz!'},
      }])
      >>> resp.json()
      {u'return': [{
          ...snip...
      }]}

.. seealso:: You can bypass the session handling via the :py:class:`Run` URL.

Usage
-----

This interface directly exposes Salt's :ref:`Python API <python-api>`.
Everything possible at the CLI is possible through the Python API. Commands are
executed on the Salt Master.

The root URL (``/``) is RPC-like in that it accepts instructions in the request
body for what Salt functions to execute, and the response contains the result
of those function calls.

For example:

.. code-block:: text

    % curl -sSi https://localhost:8000         -H 'Content-type: application/json'         -d '[{
            "client": "local",
            "tgt": "*",
            "fun": "test.ping"
        }]'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    [...snip...]

    {"return": [{"jerry": true}]}

The request body must be an array of commands. Use this workflow to build a
command:

1.  Choose a client interface.
2.  Choose a function.
3.  Fill out the remaining parameters needed for the chosen client.

The ``client`` field is a reference to the main Python classes used in Salt's
Python API. Read the full :ref:`Client APIs <client-apis>` documentation, but
in short:

* "local" uses :py:class:`LocalClient <salt.client.LocalClient>` which sends
  commands to Minions. Equivalent to the ``salt`` CLI command.
* "runner" uses :py:class:`RunnerClient <salt...b'Import of cherrypy.cpstats failed. Possible upstream bug: https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy/issues/1444'u'Import of cherrypy.cpstats failed.

    Run commands bypassing the :ref:`normal session handling
    <rest_cherrypy-auth>`.

    salt-api does not enforce authorization, Salt's eauth system does that.
    Local/Runner/WheelClient all accept ``username``/``password``/``eauth``
    **or** ``token`` kwargs that are then checked by the eauth system. The
    session mechanism in ``rest_cherrypy`` simply pairs a session with a Salt
    eauth token and then passes the ``token`` kwarg in automatically.

    If you already have a Salt eauth token, perhaps generated by the
    :py:func:`mk_token <salt.runners.auth.mk_token>` function in the Auth
    Runner module, then there is no reason to use sessions.

    This endpoint accepts either a ``username``, ``password``, ``eauth`` trio,
    **or** a ``token`` kwarg and does not make use of sessions at all.

    salt-api does not enforce authorization, Salt's eauth system does that.
    Local/Runner/WheelClient all accept ``username``/``password``/``eauth``
    **or** ``token`` kwargs that are then checked by the eauth system. The
    session mechanism in ``rest_cherrypy`` simply pairs a session with a Salt
    eauth token and then passes the ``token`` kwarg in automatically.

    If you already have a Salt eauth token, perhaps generated by the
    :py:func:`mk_token <salt.runners.auth.mk_token>` function in the Auth
    Runner module, then there is no reason to use sessions.

    This endpoint accepts either a ``username``, ``password``, ``eauth`` trio,
    **or** a ``token`` kwarg and does not make use of sessions at all.

        Note, the ``tag`` field is not part of the spec. SSE compliant clients
        should ignore unknown fields. This addition allows non-compliant
        clients to only watch for certain tags without having to deserialze the
        JSON object each time.

        The event stream can be easily consumed via JavaScript:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events');
            source.onopen = function() { console.info('Listening ...') };
            source.onerror = function(err) { console.error(err) };
            source.onmessage = function(message) {
                var saltEvent = JSON.parse(message.data);
                console.log(saltEvent.tag, saltEvent.data);
            };

        Note, the SSE stream is fast and completely asynchronous and Salt is
        very fast. If a job is created using a regular POST request, it is
        possible that the job return will be available on the SSE stream before
        the response for the POST request arrives. It is important to take that
        asynchronicity into account when designing an application. Below are
        some general guidelines.

        * Subscribe to the SSE stream _before_ creating any events.
        * Process SSE events directly as they arrive and don't wait for any
          other process to "complete" first (like an ajax request).
        * Keep a buffer of events if the event stream must be used for
          synchronous lookups.
        * Be cautious in writing Salt's event stream directly to the DOM. It is
          very busy and can quickly overwhelm the memory allocated to a
          browser tab.

        A full, working proof-of-concept JavaScript application is available
        :blob:`adjacent to this file <salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/index.html>`.
        It can be viewed by pointing a browser at the ``/app`` endpoint in a
        running ``rest_cherrypy`` instance.

        Or using CORS:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events?token=ecd589e4e01912cf3c4035afad73426dbb8dba75', {withCredentials: true});

        It is also possible to consume the stream via the shell.

        Records are separated by blank lines; the ``data:`` and ``tag:``
        prefixes will need to be removed manually before attempting to
        unserialize the JSON.

        curl's ``-N`` flag turns off input buffering which is required to
        process the stream incrementally.

        Here is a basic example of printing each event as it comes in:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    while IFS= read -r line ; do
                        echo $line
                    done

        Here is an example of using awk to filter events based on tag:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    awk '
                        BEGIN { RS=""; FS="\\n" }
                        $1 ~ /^tag: salt\/job\/[0-9]+\/new$/ { print $0 }
                    '
            tag: salt/job/20140112010149808995/new

        The event stream can be easily consumed via JavaScript:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events');
            source.onopen = function() { console.info('Listening ...') };
            source.onerror = function(err) { console.error(err) };
            source.onmessage = function(message) {
                var saltEvent = JSON.parse(message.data);
                console.log(saltEvent.tag, saltEvent.data);
            };

        Note, the SSE stream is fast and completely asynchronous and Salt is
        very fast. If a job is created using a regular POST request, it is
        possible that the job return will be available on the SSE stream before
        the response for the POST request arrives. It is important to take that
        asynchronicity into account when designing an application. Below are
        some general guidelines.

        * Subscribe to the SSE stream _before_ creating any events.
        * Process SSE events directly as they arrive and don't wait for any
          other process to "complete" first (like an ajax request).
        * Keep a buffer of events if the event stream must be used for
          synchronous lookups.
        * Be cautious in writing Salt's event stream directly to the DOM. It is
          very busy and can quickly overwhelm the memory allocated to a
          browser tab.

        A full, working proof-of-concept JavaScript application is available
        :blob:`adjacent to this file <salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/index.html>`.
        It can be viewed by pointing a browser at the ``/app`` endpoint in a
        running ``rest_cherrypy`` instance.

        Or using CORS:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var source = new EventSource('/events?token=ecd589e4e01912cf3c4035afad73426dbb8dba75', {withCredentials: true});

        It is also possible to consume the stream via the shell.

        Records are separated by blank lines; the ``data:`` and ``tag:``
        prefixes will need to be removed manually before attempting to
        unserialize the JSON.

        curl's ``-N`` flag turns off input buffering which is required to
        process the stream incrementally.

        Here is a basic example of printing each event as it comes in:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    while IFS= read -r line ; do
                        echo $line
                    done

        Here is an example of using awk to filter events based on tag:

        .. code-block:: bash

            curl -NsS localhost:8000/events |\
                    awk '
                        BEGIN { RS=""; FS="\\n" }
                        $1 ~ /^tag: salt\/job\/[0-9]+\/new$/ { print $0 }
                    '

    The event bus on the Salt master exposes a large variety of things, notably
    when executions are started on the master and also when minions ultimately

    A generic web hook entry point that fires an event on Salt's event bus

    External services can POST data to this URL to trigger an event in Salt.
    For example, Amazon SNS, Jenkins-CI or Travis-CI, or GitHub web hooks.

    .. note:: Be mindful of security

        Salt's Reactor can run any code. A Reactor SLS that responds to a hook
        event is responsible for validating that the event came from a trusted
        source and contains valid data.

        **This is a generic interface and securing it is up to you!**

        This URL requires authentication however not all external services can
        be configured to authenticate. For this reason authentication can be
        selectively disabled for this URL. Follow best practices -- always use
        SSL, pass a secret key, configure the firewall to only allow traffic
        from a known source, etc.

    The event data is taken from the request body. The
    :mailheader:`Content-Type` header is respected for the payload.

    The event tag is prefixed with ``salt/netapi/hook`` and the URL path is
    appended to the end. For example, a ``POST`` request sent to
    ``/hook/mycompany/myapp/mydata`` will produce a Salt event with the tag
    ``salt/netapi/hook/mycompany/myapp/mydata``.

            curl -sS localhost:8000/hook \
                -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
                -d '{"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}'

        .. code-block:: text

            POST /hook HTTP/1.1
            Host: localhost:8000
            Content-Length: 16
            Content-Type: application/json

            {"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}

        **Example response**:

        .. code-block:: text

            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Content-Length: 14
            Content-Type: application/json

            {"success": true}

        As a practical example, an internal continuous-integration build
        server could send an HTTP POST request to the URL
        ``https://localhost:8000/hook/mycompany/build/success`` which contains
        the result of a build and the SHA of the version that was built as
        JSON. That would then produce the following event in Salt that could be
        used to kick off a deployment via Salt's Reactor::

            Event fired at Fri Feb 14 17:40:11 2014
            *************************
            Tag: salt/netapi/hook/mycompany/build/success
            Data:

        And finally deploy the new build:

        .. code-block:: jinja

            {% set secret_key = data.get('headers', {}).get('X-My-Secret-Key') %}
            {% set build = data.get('post', {}) %}

            {% if secret_key == 'F0fAgoQjIT@W' and build.result == True %}

        On minions running systemd>=205, `systemd-run(1)`_ is now used to
        isolate commands which modify installed packages from the
        ``salt-minion`` daemon's control group. This is done to keep systemd
        from killing any apt-get/dpkg commands spawned by Salt when the
        ``salt-minion`` service is restarted. (see ``KillMode`` in the
        `systemd.kill(5)`_ manpage for more information). If desired, usage of
        `systemd-run(1)`_ can be suppressed by setting a :mod:`config option
        <salt.modules.config.get>` called ``systemd.scope``, with a value of
        ``False`` (no quotes).

    .. _`systemd-run(1)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-run.html
    .. _`systemd.kill(5)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html

    Install the passed package, add refresh=True to update the dpkg database.

    name
        The name of the package to be installed. Note that this parameter is
        ignored if either "pkgs" or "sources" is passed. Additionally, please
        note that this option can only be used to install packages from a
        software repository. To install a package file manually, use the
        "sources" option.

        32-bit packages can be installed on 64-bit systems by appending the
        architecture designation (``:i386``, etc.) to the end of the package
        name.

        CLI Example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' pkg.install <package name>

    refresh
        Whether or not to refresh the package database before installing.

    cache_valid_time

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

        Skip refreshing the package database if refresh has already occurred within
        <value> seconds

    fromrepo
        Specify a package repository to install from
        (e.g., ``apt-get -t unstable install somepackage``)

    skip_verify
        Skip the GPG verification check (e.g., ``--allow-unauthenticated``, or
        ``--force-bad-verify`` for install from package file).

    debconf
        Provide the path to a debconf answers file, processed before
        installation.

    version
        Install a specific version of the package, e.g. 1.2.3~0ubuntu0. Ignored
        if "pkgs" or "sources" is passed.

        .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
            version can now contain comparison operators (e.g. ``>1.2.3``,
            ``<=2.0``, etc.)

    reinstall : False
        Specifying reinstall=True will use ``apt-get install --reinstall``
        rather than simply ``apt-get install`` for requested packages that are
        already installed.

        If a version is specified with the requested package, then ``apt-get
        install --reinstall`` will only be used if the installed version
        matches the requested version.

        .. versionadded:: 2015.8.0

    ignore_epoch : False
        Only used when the version of a package is specified using a comparison
        operator (e.g. ``>4.1``). If set to ``True``, then the epoch will be
        ignored when comparing the currently-installed version to the desired
        version.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    Multiple Package Installation Options:

    pkgs
        A list of packages to install from a software repository. Must be
        passed as a python list.

        CLI Example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' pkg.install pkgs='["foo", "bar"]'
            salt '*' pkg.install pkgs='["foo", {"bar": "1.2.3-0ubuntu0"}]'

    sources
        A list of DEB packages to install. Must be passed as a list of dicts,
        with the keys being package names, and the values being the source URI
        or local path to the package.  Dependencies are automatically resolved
        and marked as auto-installed.

        32-bit packages can be installed on 64-bit systems by appending the
        architecture designation (``:i386``, etc.) to the end of the package
        name.

        .. versionchanged:: 2014.7.0

        CLI Example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' pkg.install sources='[{"foo": "salt://foo.deb"},{"bar": "salt://bar.deb"}]'

    force_yes
        Passes ``--force-yes`` to the apt-get command.  Don't use this unless
        you know what you're doing.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17.4

    install_recommends
        Whether to install the packages marked as recommended.  Default is True.

        .. versionadded:: 2015.5.0

    only_upgrade
        Only upgrade the packages, if they are already installed. Default is False.

        .. versionadded:: 2015.5.0

    force_conf_new
        Always install the new version of any configuration files.

        .. versionadded:: 2015.8.0

    Returns a dict containing the new package names and versions::

        On minions running systemd>=205, `systemd-run(1)`_ is now used to
        isolate commands which modify installed packages from the
        ``salt-minion`` daemon's control group. This is done to keep systemd
        from killing any apt-get/dpkg commands spawned by Salt when the
        ``salt-minion`` service is restarted. (see ``KillMode`` in the
        `systemd.kill(5)`_ manpage for more information). If desired, usage of
        `systemd-run(1)`_ can be suppressed by setting a :mod:`config option
        <salt.modules.config.get>` called ``systemd.scope``, with a value of
        ``False`` (no quotes).

    Modify one or more values for a repo.  If the repo does not exist, it will
    be created, so long as the definition is well formed.  For Ubuntu the
    ``ppa:<project>/repo`` format is acceptable. ``ppa:`` format can only be
    used to create a new repository.

    The following options are available to modify a repo definition:

    architectures
        A comma-separated list of supported architectures, e.g. ``amd64`` If
        this option is not set, all architectures (configured in the system)
        will be used.

    comps
        A comma separated list of components for the repo, e.g. ``main``

    file
        A file name to be used

    keyserver
        Keyserver to get gpg key from

    comments
        Sometimes you want to supply additional information, but not as
        enabled configuration. All comments provided here will be joined
        into a single string and appended to the repo configuration with a
        comment marker (#) before it.

        .. versionadded:: 2015.8.9

    refresh : True
        Enable or disable (True or False) refreshing of the apt package
        database. The previous ``refresh_db`` argument was deprecated in
        favor of ``refresh```. The ``refresh_db`` argument will still
        continue to work to ensure backwards compatibility, but please
        change to using the preferred ``refresh``.

    .. note::
        Due to the way keys are stored for APT, there is a known issue where
        the key won't be updated unless another change is made at the same
        time. Keys should be properly added on initial configuration.

    List the files that belong to a package. Not specifying any packages will
    return a list of _every_ file on the system's package database (not
    generally recommended).

    CLI Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' pkg.file_list httpd
        salt '*' pkg.file_list httpd postfix
        salt '*' pkg.file_list

    List the files that belong to a package, grouped by package. Not
    specifying any packages will return a list of _every_ file on the system's
    package database (not generally recommended).

    CLI Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' pkg.file_dict httpd postfix
        salt '*' pkg.file_dict
    lowpkg.file_dict_expand_repo_defos_nameos_codename
    Take a repository definition and expand it to the full pkg repository dict
    that can be used for comparison.  This is a helper function to make
    the Debian/Ubuntu apt sources sane for comparison in the pkgrepo states.

    This is designed to be called from pkgrepo states and will have little use
    being called on the CLI.

    Parses the format from ``dpkg --get-selections`` and return a format that
    pkg.get_selections and pkg.set_selections work with.
    
    View package state from the dpkg database.

    Returns a dict of dicts containing the state, and package names:

    .. code-block:: python

        {'<host>':
            {'<state>': ['pkg1',
                         ...
                        ]
            },
            ...
        }

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' pkg.get_selections
        salt '*' pkg.get_selections 'python-*'
        salt '*' pkg.get_selections state=hold
        salt '*' pkg.get_selections 'openssh*' state=hold
    --get-selections
    Change package state in the dpkg database.

    The state can be any one of, documented in ``dpkg(1)``:

    - install
    - hold
    - deinstall
    - purge

    This command is commonly used to mark specific packages to be held from
    being upgraded, that is, to be kept at a certain version. When a state is
    changed to anything but being held, then it is typically followed by
    ``apt-get -u dselect-upgrade``.

    Note: Be careful with the ``clear`` argument, since it will start
    with setting all packages to deinstall state.

    Returns a dict of dicts containing the package names, and the new and old
    versions:

    .. code-block:: python

        {'<host>':
            {'<package>': {'new': '<new-state>',
                           'old': '<old-state>'}
            },

    .. versionadded:: 2014.7.0

    Return the name of the package that owns the file. Multiple file paths can
    be passed. Like :mod:`pkg.version <salt.modules.aptpkg.version>`, if a
    single path is passed, a string will be returned, and if multiple paths are
    passed, a dictionary of file/package name pairs will be returned.

    If the file is not owned by a package, or is not present on the minion,
    then an empty string will be returned for that path.

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' pkg.owner /usr/bin/apachectl
        salt '*' pkg.owner /usr/bin/apachectl /usr/bin/basename
    -Sno path found
    .. versionadded:: 2019.2.0

    Runs an ``apt-cache show`` on the passed package names, and returns the
    results in a nested dictionary. The top level of the return data will be
    the package name, with each package name mapping to a dictionary of version
    numbers to any additional information returned by ``apt-cache show``.

    filter
        An optional comma-separated list (or quoted Python list) of
        case-insensitive keys on which to filter. This allows one to restrict
        the information returned for each package to a smaller selection of
        pertinent items.

    refresh : False
        If ``True``, the apt cache will be refreshed first. By default, no
        refresh is performed.

    CLI Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt myminion pkg.show gawk
        salt myminion pkg.show 'nginx-*'
        salt myminion pkg.show 'nginx-*' filter=description,provides

    Returns all available packages. Optionally, package names (and name globs)
    can be passed and the results will be filtered to packages matching those
    names.

    This function can be helpful in discovering the version or repo to specify
    in a :mod:`pkg.installed <salt.states.pkg.installed>` state.

    The return data will be a dictionary mapping package names to a list of
    version numbers, ordered from newest to oldest. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            'bash': ['4.3-14ubuntu1.1',
                     '4.3-14ubuntu1'],

    Change package state in the dpkg database.

    The state can be any one of, documented in ``dpkg(1)``:

    - install

        The rarfile_ Python module is now supported for listing the contents of
        rar archives. This is necessary on minions with older releases of the
        ``rar`` CLI tool, which do not support listing the contents in a
        parsable format.

    .. _rarfile: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile

    List the files and directories in an tar, zip, or rar archive.

    .. note::
        This function will only provide results for XZ-compressed archives if
        the xz_ CLI command is available, as Python does not at this time
        natively support XZ compression in its tarfile_ module. Keep in mind
        however that most Linux distros ship with xz_ already installed.

        To check if a given minion has xz_, the following Salt command can be
        run:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id cmd.which xz

        If ``None`` is returned, then xz_ is not present and must be installed.
        It is widely available and should be packaged as either ``xz`` or
        ``xz-utils``.

    name
        Path/URL of archive

    archive_format
        Specify the format of the archive (``tar``, ``zip``, or ``rar``). If
        this argument is omitted, the archive format will be guessed based on
        the value of the ``name`` parameter.

    options
        **For tar archives only.** This function will, by default, try to use
        the tarfile_ module from the Python standard library to get a list of
        files/directories. If this method fails, then it will fall back to
        using the shell to decompress the archive to stdout and pipe the
        results to ``tar -tf -`` to produce a list of filenames. XZ-compressed
        archives are already supported automatically, but in the event that the
        tar archive uses a different sort of compression not supported natively
        by tarfile_, this option can be used to specify a command that will
        decompress the archive to stdout. For example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id archive.list /path/to/foo.tar.gz options='gzip --decompress --stdout'

        .. note::
            It is not necessary to manually specify options for gzip'ed
            archives, as gzip compression is natively supported by tarfile_.

    strip_components
        This argument specifies a number of top-level directories to strip from
        the results. This is similar to the paths that would be extracted if
        ``--strip-components`` (or ``--strip``) were used when extracting tar
        archives.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.2

    clean : False
        Set this value to ``True`` to delete the path referred to by ``name``
        once the contents have been listed. This option should be used with
        care.

        .. note::
            If there is an error listing the archive's contents, the cached
            file will not be removed, to allow for troubleshooting.

    verbose : False
        If ``False``, this function will return a list of files/dirs in the
        archive. If ``True``, it will return a dictionary categorizing the
        paths into separate keys containing the directory names, file names,
        and also directories/files present in the top level of the archive.

        .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.2
            This option now includes symlinks in their own list. Before, they
            were included with files.

    saltenv : base
        Specifies the fileserver environment from which to retrieve
        ``archive``. This is only applicable when ``archive`` is a file from
        the ``salt://`` fileserver.

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        list, and the ``cwd`` and ``template`` arguments are optional.

    Uses the tar command to pack, unpack, etc. tar files


    options
        Options to pass to the tar command

        .. versionchanged:: 2015.8.0

            The mandatory `-` prefixing has been removed.  An options string
            beginning with a `--long-option`, would have uncharacteristically
            needed its first `-` removed under the former scheme.

            Also, tar will parse its options differently if short options are
            used with or without a preceding `-`, so it is better to not
            confuse the user into thinking they're using the non-`-` format,
            when really they are using the with-`-` format.

        The rarfile_ Python module is now supported for listing the contents of
        rar archives. This is necessary on minions with older releases of the
        ``rar`` CLI tool, which do not support listing the contents in a
        parsable format.

    .. _rarfile: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile

    List the files and directories in an tar, zip, or rar archive.

    .. note::
        This function will only provide results for XZ-compressed archives if
        the xz_ CLI command is available, as Python does not at this time
        natively support XZ compression in its tarfile_ module. Keep in mind
        however that most Linux distros ship with xz_ already installed.

        To check if a given minion has xz_, the following Salt command can be
        run:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id cmd.which xz

        If ``None`` is returned, then xz_ is not present and must be installed.
        It is widely available and should be packaged as either ``xz`` or
        ``xz-utils``.

    name
        Path/URL of archive

    archive_format
        Specify the format of the archive (``tar``, ``zip``, or ``rar``). If
        this argument is omitted, the archive format will be guessed based on
        the value of the ``name`` parameter.

    options
        **For tar archives only.** This function will, by default, try to use
        the tarfile_ module from the Python standard library to get a list of
        files/directories. If this method fails, then it will fall back to
        using the shell to decompress the archive to stdout and pipe the
        results to ``tar -tf -`` to produce a list of filenames. XZ-compressed
        archives are already supported automatically, but in the event that the
        tar archive uses a different sort of compression not supported natively
        by tarfile_, this option can be used to specify a command that will
        decompress the archive to stdout. For example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id archive.list /path/to/foo.tar.gz options='gzip --decompress --stdout'

        .. note::
            It is not necessary to manually specify options for gzip'ed
            archives, as gzip compression is natively supported by tarfile_.

    strip_components
        This argument specifies a number of top-level directories to strip from
        the results. This is similar to the paths that would be extracted if
        ``--strip-components`` (or ``--strip``) were used when extracting tar
        archives.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.2

    clean : False
        Set this value to ``True`` to delete the path referred to by ``name``
        once the contents have been listed. This option should be used with
        care.

        .. note::
            If there is an error listing the archive's contents, the cached
            file will not be removed, to allow for troubleshooting.

    verbose : False
        If ``False``, this function will return a list of files/dirs in the
        archive. If ``True``, it will return a dictionary categorizing the
        paths into separate keys containing the directory names, file names,
        and also directories/files present in the top level of the archive.

        .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.2
            This option now includes symlinks in their own list. Before, they
            were included with files.

        the ``salt://`` fileserver.

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified

        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via

        The rarfile_ Python module is now supported for listing the contents of
        rar archives. This is necessary on minions with older releases of the
        ``rar`` CLI tool, which do not support listing the contents in a
        parsable format.

    .. _rarfile: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile

    List the files and directories in an tar, zip, or rar archive.

    .. note::
        This function will only provide results for XZ-compressed archives if
        the xz_ CLI command is available, as Python does not at this time
        natively support XZ compression in its tarfile_ module. Keep in mind
        however that most Linux distros ship with xz_ already installed.

        To check if a given minion has xz_, the following Salt command can be
        run:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id cmd.which xz

        If ``None`` is returned, then xz_ is not present and must be installed.
        It is widely available and should be packaged as either ``xz`` or
        ``xz-utils``.

    name
        Path/URL of archive

    archive_format
        Specify the format of the archive (``tar``, ``zip``, or ``rar``). If
        this argument is omitted, the archive format will be guessed based on
        the value of the ``name`` parameter.

    options
        **For tar archives only.** This function will, by default, try to use
        the tarfile_ module from the Python standard library to get a list of
        files/directories. If this method fails, then it will fall back to
        using the shell to decompress the archive to stdout and pipe the
        results to ``tar -tf -`` to produce a list of filenames. XZ-compressed
        archives are already supported automatically, but in the event that the
        tar archive uses a different sort of compression not supported natively
        by tarfile_, this option can be used to specify a command that will
        decompress the archive to stdout. For example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt minion_id archive.list /path/to/foo.tar.gz options='gzip --decompress --stdout'

        .. note::
            It is not necessary to manually specify options for gzip'ed
            archives, as gzip compression is natively supported by tarfile_.

    strip_components
        This argument specifies a number of top-level directories to strip from
        the results. This is similar to the paths that would be extracted if
        ``--strip-components`` (or ``--strip``) were used when extracting tar
        archives.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.2

    clean : False
        Set this value to ``True`` to delete the path referred to by ``name``
        once the contents have been listed. This option should be used with
        care.

        .. note::
            If there is an error listing the archive's contents, the cached
            file will not be removed, to allow for troubleshooting.

    verbose : False
        If ``False``, this function will return a list of files/dirs in the
        archive. If ``True``, it will return a dictionary categorizing the
        paths into separate keys containing the directory names, file names,
        and also directories/files present in the top level of the archive.

        .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.2
            This option now includes symlinks in their own list. Before, they
            were included with files.

    saltenv : base
        Specifies the fileserver environment from which to retrieve
        ``archive``. This is only applicable when ``archive`` is a file from
        the ``salt://`` fileserver.

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the

    zip_file
        Path of zip file to be created

    sources
        Comma-separated list of sources to include in the zip file. Sources can
        also be passed in a Python list.

        .. versionchanged:: 2017.7.0
            Globbing is now supported for this argument

    template : None
        Can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template engine to render
        the command arguments before execution:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' archive.zip template=jinja /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/{{grains.id}}.txt

    cwd : None
        Use this argument along with relative paths in ``sources`` to create
        zip files which do not contain the leading directories. If not
        specified, the zip file will be created as if the cwd was ``/``, and
        creating a zip file of ``/foo/bar/baz.txt`` will contain the parent
        directories ``foo`` and ``bar``. To create a zip file containing just
        ``baz.txt``, the following command would be used:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' archive.zip /tmp/baz.zip baz.txt cwd=/foo/bar

    runas : None
        Create the zip file as the specified user. Defaults to the user under
        which the minion is running.

    zip64 : False
        Used to enable ZIP64 support, necessary to create archives larger than
        4 GByte in size.
        If true, will create ZIP file with the ZIPp64 extension when the zipfile
        is larger than 2 GB.
        ZIP64 extension is disabled by default in the Python native zip support
        because the default zip and unzip commands on Unix (the InfoZIP utilities)
        don't support these extensions.

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' archive.zip /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/sourcefile2
        # Globbing for sources (2017.7.0 and later)

    .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.0,3005
        This state has been rewritten. Some arguments are new to this release
        and will not be available in the 2016.3 release cycle (and earlier).
        Additionally, the **ZIP Archive Handling** section below applies
        specifically to the 2016.11.0 release (and newer).

    Ensure that an archive is extracted to a specific directory.

    .. important::
        **Changes for 2016.11.0**

        In earlier releases, this state would rely on the ``if_missing``
        argument to determine whether or not the archive needed to be
        extracted. When this argument was not passed, then the state would just
        assume ``if_missing`` is the same as the ``name`` argument (i.e. the
        parent directory into which the archive would be extracted).

        This caused a number of annoyances. One such annoyance was the need to
        know beforehand a path that would result from the extraction of the
        archive, and setting ``if_missing`` to that directory, like so:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www
                - if_missing: /var/www/myapp-16.2.4

        If ``/var/www`` already existed, this would effectively make
        ``if_missing`` a required argument, just to get Salt to extract the
        archive.

        Some users worked around this by adding the top-level directory of the
        archive to the end of the ``name`` argument, and then used ``--strip``
        or ``--strip-components`` to remove that top-level dir when extracting:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www/myapp-16.2.4
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www

        With the rewrite for 2016.11.0, these workarounds are no longer
        necessary. ``if_missing`` is still a supported argument, but it is no
        longer required. The equivalent SLS in 2016.11.0 would be:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www

        Salt now uses a function called :py:func:`archive.list
        <salt.modules.archive.list>` to get a list of files/directories in the
        archive. Using this information, the state can now check the minion to
        see if any paths are missing, and know whether or not the archive needs
        to be extracted. This makes the ``if_missing`` argument unnecessary in
        most use cases.

    .. important::
        **ZIP Archive Handling**

        *Note: this information applies to 2016.11.0 and later.*

        Salt has two different functions for extracting ZIP archives:

        1. :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>`, which uses
           Python's zipfile_ module to extract ZIP files.
        2. :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`, which
           uses the ``unzip`` CLI command to extract ZIP files.

        Salt will prefer the use of :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip
        <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>` when CLI options are specified (via
        the ``options`` argument), and will otherwise prefer the
        :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>` function. Use
        of :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>` can be
        forced however by setting the ``use_cmd_unzip`` argument to ``True``.
        By contrast, setting this argument to ``False`` will force usage of
        :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>`. For example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            /var/www:
              archive.extracted:
                - source: salt://foo/bar/myapp.zip
                - use_cmd_unzip: True

        When ``use_cmd_unzip`` is omitted, Salt will choose which extraction
        function to use based on the source archive and the arguments passed to
        the state. When in doubt, simply do not set this argument; it is
        provided as a means of overriding the logic Salt uses to decide which
        function to use.

        There are differences in the features available in both extraction
        functions. These are detailed below.

        - *Command-line options* (only supported by :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip
          <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`) - When the ``options`` argument is
          used, :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`
          is the only function that can be used to extract the archive.
          Therefore, if ``use_cmd_unzip`` is specified and set to ``False``,
          and ``options`` is also set, the state will not proceed.

        - *Permissions* - Due to an `upstream bug in Python`_, permissions are
          not preserved when the zipfile_ module is used to extract an archive.
          As of the 2016.11.0 release, :py:func:`archive.unzip
          <salt.modules.archive.unzip>` (as well as this state) has an
          ``extract_perms`` argument which, when set to ``True`` (the default),
          will attempt to match the permissions of the extracted
          files/directories to those defined within the archive. To disable
          this functionality and have the state not attempt to preserve the
          permissions from the ZIP archive, set ``extract_perms`` to ``False``:

          .. code-block:: yaml

              /var/www:
                archive.extracted:
                  - source: salt://foo/bar/myapp.zip
                  - extract_perms: False

    .. _`upstream bug in Python`: https://bugs.python.org/issue15795

    name
        Directory into which the archive should be extracted

    source
        Archive to be extracted

        .. note::
            This argument uses the same syntax as its counterpart in the
            :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` state.

    source_hash
        Hash of source file, or file with list of hash-to-file mappings

        .. note::
            This argument uses the same syntax as its counterpart in the
            :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` state.

        .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.0
            If this argument specifies the hash itself, instead of a URI to a
            file containing hashes, the hash type can now be omitted and Salt
            will determine the hash type based on the length of the hash. For
            example, both of the below states are now valid, while before only
            the second one would be:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            foo_app:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/foo.tar.gz
                - source_hash: 3360db35e682f1c5f9c58aa307de16d41361618c

            bar_app:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/bar.tar.gz
                - source_hash: sha1=5edb7d584b82ddcbf76e311601f5d4442974aaa5

    source_hash_name
        When ``source_hash`` refers to a hash file, Salt will try to find the
        correct hash by matching the filename part of the ``source`` URI. When
        managing a file with a ``source`` of ``salt://files/foo.tar.gz``, then
        the following line in a hash file would match:

        .. code-block:: text

            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    foo.tar.gz

        This line would also match:

        .. code-block:: text

            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    ./dir1/foo.tar.gz

        However, sometimes a hash file will include multiple similar paths:

        .. code-block:: text

            37b51d194a7513e45b56f6524f2d51f2    ./dir1/foo.txt
            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    ./dir2/foo.txt
            73feffa4b7f6bb68e44cf984c85f6e88    ./dir3/foo.txt

        In cases like this, Salt may match the incorrect hash. This argument
        can be used to tell Salt which filename to match, to ensure that the
        correct hash is identified. For example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            /var/www:
              archive.extracted:
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/dir2/foo.tar.gz
                - source_hash: https://mydomain.tld/hashes
                - source_hash_name: ./dir2/foo.tar.gz

        .. note::
            This argument must contain the full filename entry from the
            checksum file, as this argument is meant to disambiguate matches
            for multiple files that have the same basename. So, in the
            example above, simply using ``foo.txt`` would not match.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    source_hash_update : False
        Set this to ``True`` if archive should be extracted if source_hash has
        changed and there is a difference between the archive and the local files.
        This would extract regardless of the ``if_missing`` parameter.

        Note that this is only checked if the ``source`` value has not changed.
        If it has (e.g. to increment a version number in the path) then the
        archive will not be extracted even if the hash has changed.

        .. note::
            Setting this to ``True`` along with ``keep_source`` set to ``False``
            will result the ``source`` re-download to do a archive file list check.
            If it's not desirable please consider the ``skip_files_list_verify``
            argument.

        This state has been rewritten. Some arguments are new to this release
        and will not be available in the 2016.3 release cycle (and earlier).
        Additionally, the **ZIP Archive Handling** section below applies
        specifically to the 2016.11.0 release (and newer).

    Ensure that an archive is extracted to a specific directory.

    .. important::
        **Changes for 2016.11.0**

        In earlier releases, this state would rely on the ``if_missing``
        argument to determine whether or not the archive needed to be
        extracted. When this argument was not passed, then the state would just
        assume ``if_missing`` is the same as the ``name`` argument (i.e. the
        parent directory into which the archive would be extracted).

        This caused a number of annoyances. One such annoyance was the need to
        know beforehand a path that would result from the extraction of the
        archive, and setting ``if_missing`` to that directory, like so:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www
                - if_missing: /var/www/myapp-16.2.4

        If ``/var/www`` already existed, this would effectively make
        ``if_missing`` a required argument, just to get Salt to extract the
        archive.

        Some users worked around this by adding the top-level directory of the
        archive to the end of the ``name`` argument, and then used ``--strip``
        or ``--strip-components`` to remove that top-level dir when extracting:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www/myapp-16.2.4
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www

        With the rewrite for 2016.11.0, these workarounds are no longer
        necessary. ``if_missing`` is still a supported argument, but it is no
        longer required. The equivalent SLS in 2016.11.0 would be:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            extract_myapp:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: salt://apps/src/myapp-16.2.4.tar.gz
                - user: www
                - group: www

        Salt now uses a function called :py:func:`archive.list
        <salt.modules.archive.list>` to get a list of files/directories in the
        archive. Using this information, the state can now check the minion to
        see if any paths are missing, and know whether or not the archive needs
        to be extracted. This makes the ``if_missing`` argument unnecessary in
        most use cases.

    .. important::
        **ZIP Archive Handling**

        *Note: this information applies to 2016.11.0 and later.*

        Salt has two different functions for extracting ZIP archives:

        1. :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>`, which uses
           Python's zipfile_ module to extract ZIP files.
        2. :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`, which
           uses the ``unzip`` CLI command to extract ZIP files.

        Salt will prefer the use of :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip
        <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>` when CLI options are specified (via
        the ``options`` argument), and will otherwise prefer the
        :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>` function. Use
        of :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>` can be
        forced however by setting the ``use_cmd_unzip`` argument to ``True``.
        By contrast, setting this argument to ``False`` will force usage of
        :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>`. For example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            /var/www:
              archive.extracted:
                - source: salt://foo/bar/myapp.zip
                - use_cmd_unzip: True

        When ``use_cmd_unzip`` is omitted, Salt will choose which extraction
        function to use based on the source archive and the arguments passed to
        the state. When in doubt, simply do not set this argument; it is
        provided as a means of overriding the logic Salt uses to decide which
        function to use.

        There are differences in the features available in both extraction
        functions. These are detailed below.

        - *Command-line options* (only supported by :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip
          <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`) - When the ``options`` argument is
          used, :py:func:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`
          is the only function that can be used to extract the archive.
          Therefore, if ``use_cmd_unzip`` is specified and set to ``False``,
          and ``options`` is also set, the state will not proceed.

        - *Permissions* - Due to an `upstream bug in Python`_, permissions are
          not preserved when the zipfile_ module is used to extract an archive.
          As of the 2016.11.0 release, :py:func:`archive.unzip
          <salt.modules.archive.unzip>` (as well as this state) has an
          ``extract_perms`` argument which, when set to ``True`` (the default),
          will attempt to match the permissions of the extracted
          files/directories to those defined within the archive. To disable
          this functionality and have the state not attempt to preserve the
          permissions from the ZIP archive, set ``extract_perms`` to ``False``:

          .. code-block:: yaml

              /var/www:
                archive.extracted:
                  - source: salt://foo/bar/myapp.zip
                  - extract_perms: False

    .. _`upstream bug in Python`: https://bugs.python.org/issue15795

    name
        Directory into which the archive should be extracted

    source
        Archive to be extracted

        .. note::
            This argument uses the same syntax as its counterpart in the
            :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` state.

    source_hash
        Hash of source file, or file with list of hash-to-file mappings

        .. note::
            This argument uses the same syntax as its counterpart in the
            :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` state.

        .. versionchanged:: 2016.11.0
            If this argument specifies the hash itself, instead of a URI to a
            file containing hashes, the hash type can now be omitted and Salt
            will determine the hash type based on the length of the hash. For
            example, both of the below states are now valid, while before only
            the second one would be:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            foo_app:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/foo.tar.gz
                - source_hash: 3360db35e682f1c5f9c58aa307de16d41361618c

            bar_app:
              archive.extracted:
                - name: /var/www
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/bar.tar.gz
                - source_hash: sha1=5edb7d584b82ddcbf76e311601f5d4442974aaa5

    source_hash_name
        When ``source_hash`` refers to a hash file, Salt will try to find the
        correct hash by matching the filename part of the ``source`` URI. When
        managing a file with a ``source`` of ``salt://files/foo.tar.gz``, then
        the following line in a hash file would match:

        .. code-block:: text

            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    foo.tar.gz

        This line would also match:

        .. code-block:: text

            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    ./dir1/foo.tar.gz

        However, sometimes a hash file will include multiple similar paths:

        .. code-block:: text

            37b51d194a7513e45b56f6524f2d51f2    ./dir1/foo.txt
            acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8    ./dir2/foo.txt
            73feffa4b7f6bb68e44cf984c85f6e88    ./dir3/foo.txt

        In cases like this, Salt may match the incorrect hash. This argument
        can be used to tell Salt which filename to match, to ensure that the
        correct hash is identified. For example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            /var/www:
              archive.extracted:
                - source: https://mydomain.tld/dir2/foo.tar.gz
                - source_hash: https://mydomain.tld/hashes
                - source_hash_name: ./dir2/foo.tar.gz

        .. note::
            This argument must contain the full filename entry from the
            checksum file, as this argument is meant to disambiguate matches
            for multiple files that have the same basename. So, in the
            example above, simply using ``foo.txt`` would not match.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    source_hash_update : False
        Set this to ``True`` if archive should be extracted if source_hash has
        changed and there is a difference between the archive and the local files.
        This would extract regardless of the ``if_missing`` parameter.

        Note that this is only checked if the ``source`` value has not changed.
        If it has (e.g. to increment a version number in the path) then the
        archive will not be extracted even if the hash has changed.

        .. note::
            Setting this to ``True`` along with ``keep_source`` set to ``False``
            will result the ``source`` re-download to do a archive file list check.
            If it's not desirable please consider the ``skip_files_list_verify``
            argument.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.3.0

    skip_files_list_verify : False
        Set this to ``True`` if archive should be extracted if ``source_hash`` has
